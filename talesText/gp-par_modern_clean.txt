&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When April with its sweet-smelling showers<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has pierced the drought of March to the root,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And bathed every vein (of the plants) in such liquid<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;By which power the flower is created;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When the West Wind also with its sweet breath,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In every wood and field has breathed life into <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The tender new leaves, and the young sun<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Has run half its course in Aries,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And small fowls make melody,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Those that sleep all the night with open eyes<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(So Nature incites them in their hearts),<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Then folk long to go on pilgrimages,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And professional pilgrims to seek foreign shores,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To distant shrines, known in various lands;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And specially from every shire's end<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Of England to Canterbury they travel,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To seek the holy blessed martyr,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Who helped them when they were sick.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It happened that in that season on one day,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In Southwark at the Tabard Inn as I lay<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ready to go on my pilgrimage<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To Canterbury with a very devout spirit,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;At night had come into that hostelry<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Well nine and twenty in a company<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Of various sorts of people, by chance fallen<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In fellowship, and they were all pilgrims,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Who intended to ride toward Canterbury.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The bedrooms and the stables were spacious,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And we were well accommodated in the best way.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And in brief, when the sun was (gone) to rest,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I had so spoken with everyone of them <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That I was of their fellowship straightway,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And made agreement to rise early,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To take our way where I (will) tell you.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But nonetheless, while I have time and opportunity,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Before I proceed further in this tale,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It seems to me in accord with reason<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To tell you all the circumstances<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Of each of them, as it seemed to me,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And who they were, and of what social rank,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And also what clothing that they were in;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And at a knight then will I first begin.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A KNIGHT there was, and that (one was) a worthy man,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Who from the time that he first began<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To ride out, he loved chivalry,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Fidelity and good reputation, generosity and courtesy.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He was very worthy in his lord's war,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And for that he had ridden, no man farther,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As well in Christendom as in heathen lands,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And (was) ever honored for his worthiness;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He was at Alexandria when it was won.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He had sat very many times in the place of honor,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Above (knights of) all nations in Prussia;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He had campaigned in Lithuania and in Russia,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;No Christian man of his rank so often.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Also he had been in Grenada at the siege <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Of Algeciras, and had ridden in Morocco.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He was at Ayash and at Atalia,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When they were won, and in the Mediterranean<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He had been at many a noble expedition.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He had been at fifteen mortal battles,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And fought for our faith at Tlemcen<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Three times in formal duels, and each time slain his foe.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This same worthy knight had also been <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;At one time with the lord of Balat<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Against another heathen in Turkey;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And evermore he had an outstanding reputation<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And although he was brave, he was prudent,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And of his deportment as meek as is a maid.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He never yet said any rude word<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In all his life unto any sort of person.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He was a truly perfect, noble knight.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But to tell you of his clothing,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;His horses were good, but he was not gaily dressed.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He wore a tunic of coarse cloth <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;All stained (with rust) by his coat of mail,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For he was recently come (back) from his expedition,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And went to do his pilgrimage.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With him there was his son, a young SQUIRE,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A lover and a lively bachelor,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With locks curled as if they had been laid in a curler.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He was twenty years of age, I guess.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Of his stature he was of moderate height,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And wonderfully agile, and of great strength.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And he had been for a time on a cavalry expedition<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In Flanders, in Artois, and Picardy,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And conducted himself well, for so little a space of time,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In hope to stand in his lady's good graces.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He was embroidered, as if it were a mead<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;All full of fresh flowers, white and red.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Singing he was, or fluting, all the day;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He was as fresh as is the month of May.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;His gown was short, with long and wide sleeves.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He well knew how to sit on horse and handsomely ride.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He knew how to make songs and well compose (the words),<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Joust and also dance, and well draw and write.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He loved so passionately that at nighttime<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He slept no more than does a nightingale.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Courteous he was, humble, and willing to serve,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And carved before his father at the table.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He (the Knight) had A YEOMAN and no more servants <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;At that time, for it pleased him so to travel,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And he (the yeoman) was clad in coat and hood of green.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A sheaf of peacock arrows, bright and keen,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He carried under his belt very properly<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(He well knew how to care for his equipment as a yeoman should;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;His arrows did not fall short because of drooping feathers),<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And in his hand he carried a mighty bow.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He had a close-cropped head, with a brown face.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He well knew all the practice of woodcraft.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He wore an elegant archer's wrist-guard upon his arm,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And by his side a sword and a small shield,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And on that other side an elegant dagger<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Well ornamented and sharp as the point of a spear;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A Christopher-medal of bright silver on his breast.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He carried a horn, the shoulder strap was green;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He was a forester, truly, as I guess.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There was also a Nun, a PRIORESS,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Who was very simple and modest in her smiling;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Her greatest oath was but by Saint Loy;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And she was called Madam Eglantine.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She sang the divine service very well,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Intoned in her nose in a very polite manner;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And she spoke French very well and elegantly,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In the manner of Stratford at the Bow,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For French of Paris was to her unknown.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;At meals she was well taught indeed;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She let no morsel fall from her lips,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nor wet her fingers deep in her sauce;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She well knew how to carry a morsel (to her mouth) and take good care<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That no drop fell upon her breast.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Her greatest pleasure was in good manners.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She wiped her upper lip so clean<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That in her cup there was seen no tiny bit <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Of grease, when she had drunk her drink.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She reached for her food in a very seemly manner.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And surely she was of excellent deportment,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And very pleasant, and amiable in demeanor,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And she took pains to imitate the manners<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Of court, and to be dignified in behavior,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And to be considered worthy of reverence.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But to speak of her moral sense,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She was so charitable and so compassionate<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She would weep, if she saw a mouse<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Caught in a trap, if it were dead or bled.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She had some small hounds that she fed<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With roasted meat, or milk and fine white bread.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But sorely she wept if one of them were dead,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Or if someone smote it smartly with a stick;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And all was feeling and tender heart.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Her wimple was pleated in a very seemly manner,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Her nose well formed, her eyes gray as glass,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Her mouth very small, and moreover soft and red.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But surely she had a fair forehead;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It was almost nine inches broad, I believe;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For, certainly, she was not undergrown.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Her cloak was very well made , as I was aware.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;About her arm she bore of small coral <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A set of beads, adorned with large green beads,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And thereon hung a brooch of very bright gold,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;On which there was first written an A with a crown,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And after "Love conquers all."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She had another NUN with her,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Who was her secretary, and three priests.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There was a MONK, an extremely fine one,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;An outrider (a monk with business outside the monastery), who loved hunting,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A virile man, qualified to be an abbot.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He had very many fine horses in his stable,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And when he rode, one could hear his bridle<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jingle in a whistling wind as clear<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And also as loud as does the chapel belle<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Where this lord was prior of the subordinate monastery.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The rule of Saint Maurus or of Saint Benedict --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Because it was old and somewhat strict<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This same Monk let old things pass away,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And followed the broader customs of modern times.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He gave not a plucked hen for that text<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That says that hunters are not holy men,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nor that a monk, when he is heedless of rules,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Is like a fish that is out of water --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This is to say, a monk out of his cloister.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But he considered that same text not worth an oyster;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And I said his opinion was good.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Why should he study and make himself crazy,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Always to pore upon a book in the cloister,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Or work with his hands, and labor,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As Augustine commands? How shall the world be served?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Let Augustine have his work reserved to him!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Therefore he was indeed a vigorous horseman:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He had greyhounds as swift as fowl in flight;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Of tracking and of hunting for the hare<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Was all his pleasure, by no means would he refrain from it.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I saw his sleeves lined at the hand<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With squirrel fur, and that the finest in the land;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And to fasten his hood under his chin,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He had a very skillfully made pin of gold;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There was an elaborate knot in the larger end.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;His head was bald, which shone like any glass,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And his face did too, as if he had been rubbed with oil.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He was a very plump lord and in good condition;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;His eyes were prominent, and rolling in his head,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Which gleamed like a furnace under a cauldron;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;His boots supple, his horse in excellent condition.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Now certainly he was a handsome ecclesiastical dignitary;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He was not pale as a tormented spirit.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A fat swan loved he best of any roast.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;His saddle horse was as brown as is a berry.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There was a FRIAR, a pleasure-loving and merry one,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A limiter (with an assigned territory), a very solemn man.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In all the four orders of friars is no one that knows<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So much of sociability and elegant speech.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He had made very many a marriage<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Of young women at his own cost.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He was a noble supporter of his order.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Very well beloved and familiar was he<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With landowners every where in his country,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And also with worthy women of the town;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For he had power of confession,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As he said himself, more than a parish priest,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For he was licensed by his order.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He heard confession very sweetly,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And his absolution was pleasant:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He was a lenient man in giving penance,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Where he knew he would have a good gift.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For to give to a poor order (of friars)<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Is a sign that a man is well confessed;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For if he gave, he (the friar) dared to assert,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He knew that a man was repentant;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For many a man is so hard in his heart,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He can not weep, although he painfully suffers.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Therefore instead of weeping and prayers<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;One may give silver to the poor friars.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;His hood was always stuffed full of knives<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And pins, to give to fair wives.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And certainly he had a merry voice:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He well knew how to sing and play on a rote (string instrument);<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He absolutely took the prize for reciting ballads.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;His neck was white as a lily flower;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Furthermore he was strong as a champion fighter.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He knew the taverns well in every town<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And every innkeeper and barmaid<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Better than a leper or a beggar-woman,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For unto such a worthy man as he<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It was not suitable, in view of his official position,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To have acquaintance with sick lepers.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It is not respectable; it can not be profitable,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To deal with any such poor people,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But all with rich people and sellers of victuals.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And every where, where profit should arise,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He was courteous and graciously humble;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There was no man anywhere so capable (of such work).<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He was the best beggar in his house;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; [And he gave a certain fee for his grant (of begging rights);<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; None of his brethren came there in his territory;]<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For though a widow had not a shoe,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So pleasant was his "In the beginning,"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Yet he would have a farthing, before he went away.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His total profit was much more than his proper income.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And he knew how to frolic, as if he were indeed a pup.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He knew how to be much help on days for resolving disputes,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For there he was not like a cloistered monk<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With a threadbare cope, like a poor scholar,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But he was like a master of arts or a pope.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Of wide (expensive) cloth was his short cloak,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Which was round as a bell fresh from the clothespress.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Somewhat he lisped, for his affectation,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To make his English sweet upon his tongue;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And in his harping, when he had sung,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;His eyes twinkled in his head exactly<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As do the stars in the frosty night.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This worthy friar was called Huberd.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There was a MERCHANT with a forked beard,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Wearing parti-colored cloth, and proudly he sat on his horse;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Upon his head (he wore a) Flemish beaver hat,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;His boots were buckled handsomely and elegantly.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;His opinions he spoke very solemnly,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Concerning always the increase of his profits.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He wanted the sea to be guarded at all costs<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Between Middelburgh (Holland) and Orwell (England).<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He well knew how to deal in foreign currencies.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This worthy man employed his wit very well:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There was no one who knew that he was in debt,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He was so dignified in managing his affairs<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With his buying and selling and with his financial deals.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Truly, he was a worthy man indeed,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But, to say the truth, I do not know what men call him.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There was also a CLERK (scholar) from Oxford,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Who long before had begun the study of logic.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;His horse was as lean as is a rake,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And he was not very fat, I affirm,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But looked emaciated, and moreover abstemious.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;His short overcoat was very threadbare,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For he had not yet obtained an ecclesiastical living,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nor was he worldly enough to take secular employment.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For he would rather have at the head of his bed<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Twenty books, bound in black or red,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Of Aristotle and his philosophy<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Than rich robes, or a fiddle, or an elegant psaltery. <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But even though he was a philosopher,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nevertheless he had but little gold in his strongbox;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But all that he could get from his friends,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He spent on books and on learning,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And diligently did pray for the souls <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Of those who gave him the wherewithal to attend the schools.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He took most care and paid most heed to study.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He spoke not one word more than was needed,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And that was said with due formality and respect,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And short and lively and full of elevated content;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;His speech was consonant with moral virtue,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And gladly would he learn and gladly teach.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A SERGEANT OF THE LAW (high-ranking attorney), prudent and wise,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Who often had been at the Porch of St. Paul's (where lawyers gather)<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Was also there, very rich in superior qualities.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He was judicious and of great dignity --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He seemed such, his words were so wise.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He was very often a judge in the court of assizes,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;By royal appointment and with full jurisdiction.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For his knowledge and for his excellent reputation,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He had many grants of yearly income.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There was nowhere so great a land-buyer:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In fact, all was unrestricted possession to him;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;His purchasing could not be invalidated.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There was nowhere so busy a man as he, <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And yet he seemed busier than he was.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He had in Year Books all the cases and decisions<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That from the time of king William have occurred.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Furthermore, he knew how to compose and draw up a legal document,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So that no one could find a flaw in his writing;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And he knew every statute completely by heart.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He rode but simply in a parti-colored coat,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Girded with a belt of silk, with small stripes;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I tell no longer tale of his clothing.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A FRANKLIN was in his company.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;His beard was white as a daisy;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As to his temperament, he was dominated by the humor blood.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He well loved a bit of bread dipped in wine in the morning;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;His custom was always to live in delight,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For he was Epicurus' own son,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Who held the opinion that pure pleasure <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Was truly perfect happiness.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He was a householder, and a great one at that;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He was Saint Julian (patron of hospitality) in his country.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;His bread, his ale, was always of the same (good) quality;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nowhere was there any man better stocked with wine.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;His house was never without baked pies<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Of fish and meat, and that so plentiful<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That in his house it snowed with food and drink;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Of all the dainties that men could imagine,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In accord with the various seasons of the year,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So he varied his midday meal and his supper.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He had very many fat partridges in pens,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And many a bream and many a pike in his fish pond.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Woe was his cook unless his sauce was<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Hotly spiced and sharp, and ready all his cooking equipment.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In his hall his dining table always<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Stood covered (with table cloth) and ready all the long day.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He presided as lord and sire at court sessions;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He was a member of parliament many times.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A dagger and a purse all of silk<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Hung at his belt, white as morning milk.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He had been a sheriff, and an auditor of taxes.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There was nowhere such a worthy landowner.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A HABERDASHER and a CARPENTER,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A WEAVER, a DYER, and a TAPESTRY-MAKER --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And they were all clothed in one livery<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Of a solemn and a great parish guild.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Their equipment was adorned all freshly and new;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Their knives were not mounted with brass<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But entirely with silver, wrought very neatly and well,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Their belts and their purses every bit.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Each of them well seemed a solid citizen<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To sit on a dais in a city hall.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Every one of them, for the wisdom that he knows,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Was suitable to be an alderman.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For they had enough possessions and income,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And also their wives would well assent to it;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And otherwise certainly they would be to blame.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It is very fine to be called "my lady,"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And go to feasts on holiday eves heading the procession,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And have a gown with a train royally carried.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A COOK they had with them for the occasion<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To boil the chickens with the marrow bones,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And tart poudre-marchant and galingale (spices).<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He well knew how to judge a draft of London ale.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He knew how to roast, and boil, and broil, and fry,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Make stews, and well bake a pie.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But it was a great harm, as it seemed to me,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That he had an open sore on his shin.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As for white pudding, he made that of the best quality.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A SHIPMAN was there, dwelling far in the west;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For all I know, he was from Dartmouth.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He rode upon a cart horse, insofar as he knew how,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In a gown of woolen cloth (that reached) to the knee.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He had a dagger hanging on a cord <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;About his neck, down under his arm.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The hot summer had made his hue all brown;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And certainly he was a boon companion.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He had drawn very many a draft of wine<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;While coming from Bordeaux, while the merchant slept.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He had no concern for a scrupulous conscience.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;If he fought and had the upper hand,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He sent them home by water to every land (they walked the plank). <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But of his skill to reckon well his tides,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;His currents, and his perils near at hand,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;His harbors, and positions of his moon, his navigation,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There was none other such from Hull to Cartagena (Spain).<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He was bold and prudent in his undertakings;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;His beard had been shaken by many a tempest.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He knew all the harbors, how they were,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;From Gotland to the Cape of Finisterre,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And every inlet in Brittany and in Spain.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;His ship was called the Maudelayne.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With us there was a DOCTOR OF MEDICINE<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In all this world there was no one like him,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To speak of medicine and of surgery,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For he was instructed in astronomy.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He took care of his patient very many times<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In (astronomically suitable) hours by (use of) his natural science.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He well knew how to calculate the planetary position<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Of his astronomical talismans for his patient.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He knew the cause of every malady,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Were it of hot, or cold, or moist, or dry elements,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And where they were engendered, and by what bodily fluid.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He was a truly, perfect practitioner:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The cause known, and the source of his (patient's) harm,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Straightway he gave the sick man his remedy.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He had his apothecaries all ready <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To send him drugs and his electuaries,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For each of them made the other to profit --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Their friendship was not recently begun.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He well knew the old Aesculapius,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And Dioscorides, and also Rufus,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Old Hippocrates, Haly, and Galen,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Serapion, Rhazes, and Avicenna,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Averroes, John the Damascan, and Constantine,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Bernard, and Gaddesden, and Gilbertus.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He was moderate in his diet,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For it was of no excess,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But greatly nourishing and digestible.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;His study was but little on the Bible.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He was clad all in red and in blue,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Lined with taffeta and with silk.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And yet he was moderate in spending;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He kept what he earned in (times of) plague.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Since in medicine gold is a restorative for the heart,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Therefore he loved gold in particular.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There was a good WIFE OF beside BATH,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But she was somewhat deaf, and that was a pity.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She had such a skill in cloth-making <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She surpassed them of Ypres and of Ghent.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In all the parish there was no wife <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Who should go to the Offering before her;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And if there did, certainly she was so angry<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That she was out of all charity (love for her neighbor).<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Her kerchiefs were very fine in texture;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I dare swear they weighed ten pound<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That on a Sunday were upon her head.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Her stockings were of fine scarlet red,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Very closely laced, and shoes very supple and new.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Bold was her face, and fair, and red of hue.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She was a worthy woman all her life:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She had (married) five husbands at the church door,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Not counting other company in youth --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But there is no need to speak of that right now.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And she had been three times at Jerusalem;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She had passed many a foreign sea;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She had been at Rome, and at Boulogne,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In Galicia at Saint-James (of Compostella), and at Cologne.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She knew much about wandering by the way.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She had teeth widely set apart, truly to say.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She sat easily upon a pacing horse,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Wearing a large wimple, and on her head a hat<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As broad as a buckler or a shield;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;An overskirt about her large hips,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And on her feet a pair of sharp spurs.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In fellowship she well knew how to laugh and chatter.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She knew, as it happened, about remedies for love <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For she knew the old dance (tricks of the trade) of that art.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A good man was there of religion,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And (he) was a poor PARSON OF A TOWN,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But he was rich in holy thought and work.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He was also a learned man, a scholar,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Who would preach Christ's gospel truly;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He would devoutly teach his parishioners.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He was gracious, and wonderfully diligent,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And very patient in adversity,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And such he was proven many times.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He was very reluctant to excommunicate for (nonpayment of) his tithes,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But rather would he give, there is no doubt,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Unto his poor parishioners about<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Some of his offering (received at mass) and also some of his income.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He knew how to have sufficiency in few possessions.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;His parish was wide, and houses far apart,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But he did not omit, for rain nor thunder,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In sickness or in trouble to visit<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Those living farthest away in his parish, high-ranking and low,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Going by foot, and in his hand a staff.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He gave this noble example to his sheep,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That first he wrought, and afterward he taught.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He took those words out of the gospel,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And this metaphor he added also to that,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That if gold rust, what must iron do?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For if a priest, on whom we trust, should be foul<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It is no wonder for a layman to go bad;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And it is a shame, if a priest is concerned:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A shit-stained shepherd and a clean sheep.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Well ought a priest to give an example,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;By his purity, how his sheep should live.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He did not rent out his benefice (ecclesiastical living)<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And leave his sheep encumbered in the mire<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And run to London unto Saint Paul's<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To seek an appointment as a chantry priest (praying for a patron)<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Or to be hired (as a chaplain) by a guild;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But dwelt at home, and kept well his sheep fold (parish),<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So that the wolf did not make it go wrong;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He was a shepherd and not a hireling.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And though he was holy and virtuous,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He was not scornful to sinful men,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nor domineering nor haughty in his speech,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But in his teaching courteous and kind.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To draw folk to heaven by gentleness,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;By good example, this was his business.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Unless it were an obstinate person,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Whoever he was, of high or low rank,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He would rebuke him sharply at that time. <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I believe that nowhere is there a better priest.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He expected no pomp and ceremony,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nor made himself an overly fastidious conscience,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But Christ's teaching and His twelve apostles <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He taught; but first he followed it himself.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With him there was a PLOWMAN, who was his brother,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Who had hauled very many a cartload of dung;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He was a true and good worker,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Living in peace and perfect love.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He loved God best with all his whole heart<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;At all times, whether it pleased or pained him,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And then (he loved) his neighbor exactly as himself.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He would thresh, and moreover make ditches and dig,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For Christ's sake, for every poor person,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Without payment, if it lay in his power.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He paid his tithes completely and well,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Both of  his own labor and of his possessions.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He rode in a tabard (sleeveless jacket) upon a mare.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There was also a REEVE, and a MILLER,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A SUMMONER, and a PARDONER also,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A MANCIPLE, and myself -- there were no more.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The MILLER was a stout fellow indeed;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He was very strong of muscle, and also of bones.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That was well proven, for wherever he came,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;At wrestling he would always take the the prize.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He was stoutly built, broad, a large-framed fellow;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There was no door that he would not heave off its hinges,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Or break it by running at it with his head.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;His beard was red as any sow or fox,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And moreover broad, as though it were a spade.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Upon the exact top of his nose he had<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A wart, and thereon stood a tuft of hairs,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Red as the bristles of a sow's ears;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;His nostrils were black and wide.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He wore a sword and a buckler by his side.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;His mouth was as large as a large furnace.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He was a loudmouth and a buffoon,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And that was mostly of sin and deeds of harlotry.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He well knew how to steal corn and take payment three times;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And yet he had a thumb of gold, indeed.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He wore a white coat and a blue hood.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He well knew how to blow and play a bag-pipe,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And with that he brought us out of town.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There was a fine MANCIPLE of a temple (law school),<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Of whom buyers of provisions might take example<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For how to be wise in buying of victuals;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For whether he paid (cash) or took (goods) on credit,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Always he watched so (carefully for his opportunity) in his purchases<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That he was always ahead and in good state.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Now is not that a very fair grace of God <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That such an unlearned man's wit shall surpass<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The wisdom of a heap of learned men?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He had more than three times ten masters,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Who were expert and skillful in law,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Of whom there were a dozen in that house<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Worthy to be stewards of rent and land<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Of any lord that is in England,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To make him live by his own wealth<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In honor and debtless (unless he were crazy),<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Or live as economically as it pleased him to desire;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And (they would be) able to help all a shire<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In any emergency that might occur or happen.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And yet this Manciple fooled them all.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The REEVE was a slender choleric man.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;His beard was shaved as close as ever he can;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;His hair was closely cropped by his ears;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The top of his head in front was cut short like a priest's.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;His legs were very long and very lean,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Like a stick; there was no calf to be seen.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He well knew how to keep a granary and a storage bin;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There was no auditor who could earn anything (by catching him).<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He well knew by the drought and by the rain<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(What would be) the yield of his seed and of his grain.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;His lord's sheep, his cattle, his herd of dairy cows,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;His swine, his horses, his livestock, and his poultry<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Was wholly in this Reeve's control,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And in accord with his contract he gave the reckoning,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Since his lord was twenty years of age.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There was no man who could find him in arrears.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There was no farm manager, nor herdsman, nor other servant,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Whose trickery and treachery he did not know;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;They were afraid of him as of the plague.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;His dwelling was very nicely situated upon an heath;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;His place was shaded by green trees.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He could buy property better than his lord could.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He was secretly very richly provided.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He well knew how to please his lord subtly,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;By giving and lending him some of his lord's own possessions,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And have thanks, and also a coat and hood (as a reward).<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In youth he had learned a good craft:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He was a very good craftsman, a carpenter.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This Reeve sat upon a very good horse<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That was all dapple gray and was called Scot.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He had on a long outer coat of dark blue,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And by his side he wore a rusty sword.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Of Northfolk was this Reeve of whom I tell,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Near to a town men call Bawdeswelle.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He had his coat hitched up and belted, like a friar,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And ever he rode as the last of our company.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There was a SUMMONER with us in that place,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Who had a fire-red cherubim's face,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For it was pimpled and discolored, with swollen eyelids.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He was as hot and lecherous as a sparrow,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With black, scabby brows and a beard with hair fallen out.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Children were afraid of his face.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There was no mercury, lead monoxide, nor sulphur,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Borax, white lead, nor any oil of tarter,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nor ointment that would cleanse and burn,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That could cure him of his white pustules,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nor of the knobs sitting on his cheeks.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He well loved garlic, onions, and also leeks,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And to drink strong wine, red as blood;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Then he would speak and cry out as if he were crazy.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And when he had drunk deeply of the wine,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Then he would speak no word but Latin.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He had a few legal terms, two or three,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That he had learned out of some text of ecclesiastical law --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That is no wonder, he heard it all the day;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And also you know well how a jay<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Can call out "Walter" as well as the pope can.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But whoever knew how to examine him in other matters,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(Would find that) he had used up all his learning;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Always "The question is, what point of the law applies?" he would cry.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He was a fine rascal and a kind one;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;One could not find a better fellow.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For a quart of wine he would allow<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A good fellow to have his concubine<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For twelve months, and excuse him completely;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Secretly he also knew how to pull off a clever trick.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And if he found anywhere a good fellow,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He would teach him to have no awe<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Of the archdeacon's curse (of excommunication) in such a case,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Unless a man's soul were in his purse;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For in his purse he would be punished.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Purse is the archdeacon's hell," he said.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But well I know he lied right certainly;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Each guilty man ought to be afraid of excommunication,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For excommunication will slay just as forgiveness saves,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And let him also beware of a Significavit (order for imprisonment).<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In his control he had as he pleased<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The young people of the diocese,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And knew their secrets, and was the adviser of them all.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He had set a garland upon his heed,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As large as if it were for the sign of a tavern<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He had made himself a shield of a cake.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With him there rode a fine PARDONER<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Of Rouncivale, his friend and his companion,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Who had come straight from the court of Rome.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Very loud he sang "Come hither, love, to me!"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This Summoner harmonized with him in a strong bass;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There was never a trumpet of half so great a sound.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This Pardoner had hair as yellow as wax,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But smooth it hung as does a clump of flax;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;By small strands hung such locks as he had,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And he spread them over his shoulders;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But thin it lay, by strands one by one.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But to make an attractive appearance, he wore no hood,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For it was trussed up in his knapsack.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It seemed to him that he rode in the very latest style;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With hair unbound, save for his cap, he rode all bare-headed.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He had glaring eyes such as has a hare.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He had sewn a Veronica upon his cap.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Before him in his lap, (he had) his knapsack, <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Brimful of pardons come all fresh from Rome.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He had a voice as small as a goat has.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He had no beard, nor never would have;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It (his face) was as smooth as if it were recently shaven.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I believe he was a eunuch or a homosexual.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But as to his craft, from Berwick to Ware<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There was no other pardoner like him.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For in his pouch he had a pillow-case,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Which he said was Our Lady's veil;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He said he had a piece of the sail<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That Saint Peter had, when he went<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Upon the sea, until Jesus Christ took him.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He had a cross of latten (brass-like alloy) covered with stones,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And in a glass container he had pigs' bones.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But with these relics, when he found<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A poor parson dwelling in the countryside,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In one day he got himself more money<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Than the parson got in two months;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And thus, with feigned flattery and tricks,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He made fools of the parson and the people.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But truly to tell at the last,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He was in church a noble ecclesiast.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He well knew how to read a lesson or a story,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But best of all he sang an Offertory;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For he knew well, when that song was sung,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He must preach and well smooth his speech<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To win silver, as he very well knew how; <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Therefore he sang the more merrily and loud.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Now have I told you truly, briefly,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The rank, the dress, the number, and also the cause<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Why this company was assembled <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In Southwark at this fine hostelry<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That is called the Tabard, close by the Bell.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But now it is time to tell to you <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;How we conducted ourselves that same night,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When we had arrived in that hostelry;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And after that I will tell of our journey<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And all the rest of our pilgrimage.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But first I pray yow, of your courtesy,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That you do not attribute it to my rudeness,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Though I speak plainly in this matter,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To tell you their words and their behavior,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nor though I speak their words accurately.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For this you know as well as I:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Whoever must repeat a story after someone,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He must repeat as closely as ever he knows how<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Every single word, if it be in his power,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Although he may speak ever so rudely and freely,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Or else he must tell his tale inaccurately,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Or make up things, or find new words.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He may not refrain from (telling the truth), although he were his brother;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He must as well say one word as another.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Christ himself spoke very plainly in holy writ,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And you know well it is no rudeness.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Also Plato says, whosoever knows how to read him,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The words must be closely related to the deed.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Also I pray you to forgive it to me,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Although I have not set folk in order of their rank<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Here in this tale, as they should stand.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;My wit is short, you can well understand.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Our Host made great hospitality to everyone of us,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And to the supper he set us straightway.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He served us with victuals of the best sort;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The wine was strong, and it well pleased us to drink.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;OUR HOST was an impressive man indeed<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(Qualified) to be a master of ceremonies in a hall.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He was a large man with prominent eyes --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There was no better business man in Cheapside --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Bold of his speech, and wise, and well mannered,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And he lacked nothing at all of the qualities proper to a man.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Also moreover he was a right merry man;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And after supper he began to be merry,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And spoke of mirth among other things,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When we had paid our bills,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And said thus: "Now, gentlemen, truly,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;You are right heartily welcome to me;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For by my word, if I shall not lie (I must say),<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I saw not this year so merry a company<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;At one time in this lodging as is (here) now.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I would gladly make you happy, if I knew how.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And I have just now thought of an amusement,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To give you pleasure, and it shall cost nothing.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"You go to Canterbury -- God give you success,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;May the blessed martyr give you your reward!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And well I know, as you go by the way,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;You intend to tell tales and to amuse yourselves;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For truly, it is no comfort nor mirth<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To ride by the way dumb as a stone;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And therefore I will make a game for you,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As I said before, and provide you some pleasure.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And if pleases you all unanimously<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To be subject to my judgment,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And to do as I shall tell you,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Tomorrow, when you ride by the way,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Now, by the soul of my father who is dead,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Unless you be merry, I will give you my head!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Hold up your hands, without more speech."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Our decision was not long to seek out.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It seemed to us it was not worthwhile to deliberate on it,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And (we) granted his request without more discussion,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And asked him to say his decision as it pleased him.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Gentlemen," said he, "now listen for the best course of action;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But, I pray yow, do not take it in disdain (scorn it).<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This is the point, to speak briefly and clearly,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That each of yow, to make our way seem short by this means,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Must tell two tales in this journey<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;On the way to Canterbury, that is what I mean,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And on the homeward trip he shall tell two others,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;About adventures that in old times have happened.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And whoever of you who does best of all --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That is to say, who tells in this case<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Tales of best moral meaning and most pleasure --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Shall have a supper at the cost of us all<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Here in this place, sitting by this post,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When we come back from Canterbury.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And to make you the more merry,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I will myself gladly ride with you,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Entirely at my own cost, and be your guide;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And whosoever will not accept my judgment <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Shall pay all that we spend by the way.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And if you grant that it be so,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Tell me straightway, without more words,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And I will get ready early for this."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This thing was granted, and our oaths sworn<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With very glad hearts, and (we) prayed him also<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That he would consent to do so,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And that he would be our governor,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And judge and score keeper of our tales,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And set a supper at a certain price,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And we will be ruled as he wishes<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In every respect; and thus unanimously<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We are accorded to his judgment.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And thereupon the wine was fetched immediately;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We drank, and each one went to rest,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Without any longer tarrying.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In the morning, when day began to spring,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Our Host arose, and was the rooster of us all (awakened us).<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And gathered us together all in a flock,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And forth we rode at little more than a walk<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Unto the Watering of Saint Thomas;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And there our Host stopped his horse<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And said, "Gentlemen, listen, if you please.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;You know your agreement, and I remind you of it.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;If what you said last night agrees with what you say this morning, <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Let's see now who shall tell the first tale.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As ever I may drink wine or ale,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Whosoever may be rebel to my judgment<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Shall pay for all that is spent by the way.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Now draw straws, before we depart further (from London);<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He who has the shortest shall begin.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Sir Knight," said he, "my master and my lord,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Now draw a straw, for that is my decision.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Come nearer," he said, "my lady Prioress.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And you, sir Clerk, let be your modesty,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And study not; lay hand to (draw a straw), every man!"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Every person began straightway to draw,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And shortly to tell as it was,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Were it by chance, or destiny, or luck,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The truth is this: the draw fell to the Knight,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For which everyone was very happy and glad,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And he must tell his tale, as was reasonable,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;By our previous promise and by formal agreement,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As you have heard; what more words are needed?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And when this good man saw that it was so,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Like one who was wise and obedient<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To keep his agreement by his free assent,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He said, "Since I must begin the game,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;What! Welcome be the draw, in God's name!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Now let us ride, and listen to what I say."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And with that word we rode forth on our way,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And he began with a truly merry demeanor<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To tell his tale straightway, and said as you may hear.<BR>
