&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I suppose men would consider it negligence<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;If I forget to tell the expenditure<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Of Theseus, who goes (about) so busily<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To build the lists royally,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That such a noble theatre as it was<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I dare well say there was not (another such) in this world.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The circumference was a mile around,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Walled with stone, and surrounded by a ditch.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Round was the shape, in the manner of a circle,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Full of tiers of seats, the height of sixty paces,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That when a man was set on one tier of seats,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He did not hinder his fellow from seeing.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Eastward there stood a gate of white marble,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Westward just such another on the opposite (side).<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And shortly to conclude, such a place<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Was none in earth, (constructed) in so little time;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For in the land there was no skilled man<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Who knows geometry or arithmetic,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nor painter, nor carver of images,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That Theseus did not give him food and wages<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To make and devise the theatre.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And to do his rite and sacrifice,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He has eastward, upon the gate above,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In worship of Venus, goddess of love,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Had made an altar and a chapel;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And on the westward gate, in memory<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Of Mars, he has made just such another,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That cost fully a cartload of gold.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And northward, in a turret on the wall,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Of white alabaster and red coral,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A chapel, rich to look upon,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In worship of Diana of chastity,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Has Theseus had made in noble style.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But yet had I forgotten to describe<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The noble sculpture and the portraits,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The shape, the appearance, and the figures<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That were in these three chapels.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;First in the temple of Venus canst thou see<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Wrought on the wall, full piteous to behold,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The broken sleeps, and the cold sighs,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The sacred tears, and the lamenting,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The fiery strokes of the desiring<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That love's servants endure in this life;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The oaths that assure their covenants;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Pleasure and Hope, Desire, Foolhardiness,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Beauty and Youth, Mirth, Riches,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Charms and Force, Lies, Flattery,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Expenditures, Attentiveness, and Jealousy,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Who wore a garland of yellow marigolds,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And a cuckoo sitting on her hand;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Feasts, musical instruments, dance-songs, dances,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Desire and festivity, and all the details<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Of love, which I recounted and shall recount,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Were painted in sequence on the wall,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And more than I can make mention of.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For truly all the mount of Cithaeron,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Where Venus has her principal dwelling,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Was shown on the wall in portraits,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With all the garden (of Love) and the pleasure.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The porter, Idleness, was not forgotten <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nor the handsome Narcissus of many years ago,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nor yet the folly of king Solomon,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nor yet the great strength of Hercules --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The enchantments of Medea and Circes --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nor of Turnus, with the hardy fierce courage,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The riche Cresus, wretched in servitude.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Thus can you see that wisdom nor riches,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Beauty nor trickery, strength nor bravery,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Can not share power with Venus,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For she may rule the world as she pleases.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Lo, all these folk were so caught in her snare,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Until for woe they very often said "alas!"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;One or two examples here suffice,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Even though I could recount a thousand more.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The statue of Venus, glorious to look upon,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Was naked, floating in the large sea,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And from the navel down all was covered <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With waves green and bright as any glass.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She had a citole (zither-like instrument) in her right hand,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And on her head, very elegant to look upon,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A rose garland, fresh and fragrant;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Above her head her doves fluttering.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Before her stood her son Cupid;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He had two wings upon his shoulders,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And he was blind, as it is often seen;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He carried a bow and arrows bright and keen.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Why should I not as well also tell you all<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The portraiture that was upon the wall<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Within the temple of mighty Mars the red?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;All painted was the wall, in length and breadth,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Like to the interior of the grisly place<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That is called the Great Temple of Mars in Thrace,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In that same cold, frosty region<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Where Mars has his most excellent mansion.  <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;First a forest was painted on the wall,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In which there dwells neither man nor beast,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With knotty, gnarled, barren old trees,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of stumps sharp and hideous to behold,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Through which there ran a rumbling in a moaning of wind,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	As though a storm should burst every bough.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	And downward from a hill, close to a grassy slope,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	There stood the temple of Mars, powerful in arms,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Wrought all of burnished steel, of which the entry<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Was long and narrow, and frightening to look upon.  <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And out of there came a rush of wind and such a blast<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That it made all the gate to shake.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The northern light shone in at the doors,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For there was no window on the wall,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Through which men might discern any light.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The door was all of eternal adamant (hardest of stones),<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Bound crosswise and lengthwise <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With tough iron; and to make it strong,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Every pillar, to support the temple,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Was big as a large barrel, (made) of iron bright and shining.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There I saw first the malicious plotting<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Of Felony, and all the scheming;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The cruel Anger, red as any glowing coal;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The pick-purse, and also the pale Fear;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The smiler with the knife under the cloak;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The stable burning with the black smoke;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The treason of the murdering in the bed;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The open war, all covered with blood from wounds:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Strife, with bloody knife and sharp menacing.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;All full of creaking was that sorry place.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There yet I saw slayer of himself there --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;His heart-blood has bathed all his hair --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The nail driven in the top of the head at night;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The cold death, with mouth gaping upwards.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Amidst the temple sat Misfortune,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With grief and sorry countenance.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Yet I saw Madness, laughing in his rage,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Armed Discontent, Alarm, and fierce Violence;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The corpse in the woods, with (its) throat cut;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A thousand slain, and not killed by the plague;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The tyrant, with his prey taken by force;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The town destroyed, there was nothing left.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Yet I saw burned the ships dancing (on the waves);<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The hunter killed by the wild bears;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The sow devouring the child right in the cradle;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The cook scalded, despite his long-handled spoon.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nothing concerning the evil influence of Mars was forgotten.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The wagon driver run over by his wagon --   <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He lay down full low under the wheel.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There were also, of those influenced by Mars,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The barber, and the butcher, and the smith,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Who forges sharp swords on his anvil.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And all above, painted in a tower,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I saw conquest, sitting in great honor,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With the sharp sword over his head<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Hanging by a thin thread of twine.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Depicted was the slaughter of Julius,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Of great Nero, and of Antonius;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Although at that same time they were unborn,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Yet was their death depicted before then<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;By menacing of Mars, according to the horoscope;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So was it shown in that portraiture,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As is depicted in the stars above<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Who shall be slain or else dead for love.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Suffices one illustrative tale in old histories; <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I can not recount them all even if I desired to.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The statue of Mars stood upon a chariot<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Armed, and looked as grim as if he were mad;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And over his head there shine two figures<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Of stars, that are called in books,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That one Puella, that other Rubeus --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This god of arms was arrayed thus.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A wolf stood there before him at his feet<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With red eyes, and he ate of a man;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With subtle brush was depicted this story<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In reverence of Mars and of his glory.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Now to the temple of Diana the chaste,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As briefly as I can, I will hasten myself,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To tell you all the description.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The walls are painted all over<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(With scenes) of hunting and of modest chastity.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There I saw how woeful Callisto,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When Diana was angry with her,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Was turned from a woman into a bear,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And after she was made the North Star<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Thus was it painted; I can tell you no more.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Her son is also a star, as one can see.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There I saw Daphne, turned into a tree --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I mean not the goddess Diana,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But Penneus' daughter, who is called Daphne.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There I saw Actaeon changed into a hart,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For vengeance that he saw Diana all naked;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I saw how his hounds have caught him <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And devoured him, because they did not know him.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Yet was painted a little further on <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;How Atalanta hunted the wild boar,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And Meleager, and many more others,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For which Diana wrought him care and woe.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There I saw many another wonderful story,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The which I do not desire to call to mind.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This goddess sat full high on a hart,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With small hounds all about her feet,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And underneath her feet she had a moon --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Waxing it was and should wane soon.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Her statue was clothed in yellowish green,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With bow in hand and arrows in a quiver.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She cast her eyes down full low <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Where Pluto has his dark region.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A woman in childbirth was before her;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But because her child was so long unborn,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Very piteously did she call on Lucina <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And said, "Help, for thou canst (do so) best of all!"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He who made it well knew how to paint in a life-like manner;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With many a florin he bought the paints.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Now these lists are made, and Theseus,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Who at his great cost thus prepared<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The temples and the theatre in all respects,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When it was done, it greatly pleased him.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But I will stop speaking of Theseus a little while,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And speak of Palamon and of Arcite.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The day of their return approaches,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When each one should bring a hundred knights<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To decide the battle, as I told you.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And to Athens, to keep their agreement,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Each one of them has brought a hundred knights,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Well armed for the battle in all respects.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And surely many a man there believed<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That never, since the world began,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To speak of knighthood of (the deeds of) their hand,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As far as God has made sea or land,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Was not of so few so noble a company.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For every person that loved chivalry<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And would, willingly, have an outstanding reputation<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Has prayed that he might participate in that game;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And well it was for him who was chosen to be there,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For if there fell tomorrow such a situation,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;You know well that every vigorous  knight<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Who loves passionately and has his might,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Were it in England or elsewhere,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;They would, willingly, desire to be there --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To fight for a lady, bless me! <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It would be a pleasing sight to see.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And right so fared those with Palamon.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With him there went knights many a one;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;One of them will be armed in a coat of mail,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And in a breastplate and a light tunic;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And one of them will have a set of plate armor;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And one of them will have a Prussian shield or a buckler;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;One of them will be well armed on his legs,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And have an axe, and one a mace of steel --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There is no new fashion that has not been old.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;They were armed, as I have told you,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Every one according to his preference.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There mayst thou seen, coming with Palamon,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Lycurgus himself, the great king of Thrace.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Black was his beard, and manly was his face;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The circles of his eyes in his head,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;They glowed between yellow and red,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And he looked about like a griffin (with an eagle's head),<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With shaggy hairs on his stout brows;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;His limbs large, his muscles hard and strong,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;His shoulders broad, his arms round and long;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And as was the fashion in his country,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He stood full high upon a chariot of gold,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With four white bulls in the traces.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Instead of a tunic with his coat of arms over his armor,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With claws yellow and bright as any gold, <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He had a bear's skin, coal-black because of age.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;His long hair was combed behind his back;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Like any raven's feather it shone because of its blackness;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A wreath of gold, thick as an arm, of huge weight,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Upon his head, set full of bright stones,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Of fine rubies and of diamonds.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;About his chariot there went white wolfhounds,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Twenty and more, as big as any steer,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To hunt for the lion or the deer,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And followed him with muzzles securely bound,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Wearing collars of gold, and rings for leashes filed round.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He had a hundred lords in his company,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Very well armed, with stern and stout hearts.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With Arcite, as people find in histories,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The great Emetreus, the king of India,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Upon a reddish-brown steed with trappings of steel,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Covered in cloth of gold, well decorated  (with geometric patterns),<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Came riding like the god of arms, Mars.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;His tunic with his coat of arms was of cloth of Tarsia (in Turkestan)<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Adorned with pearls white and round and big;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;His saddle was newly adorned with pure gold;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A short cloak hanging upon his shoulder,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Brimful of rubies red as sparkling fire;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;His curly hair like rings was run (fashioned),<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And that was yellow, and glittered like the sun.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;His nose was high, his eyes bright lemon yellow,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;His lips round, his color was ruddy;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A few freckles were sprinkled in his face,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Between yellow and somewhat mingled with black;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And as a lion he cast about his look.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I reckon his age at five and twenty years.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;His beard had well begun to spring;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;His voice was like a trumpet thundering.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Upon his head he wore of green laurel <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A garland, fresh and pleasing to look upon.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Upon his hand he carried for his delight<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A tame eagle, white as any lily.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He had a hundred lords with him there,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;All armed, except for their heads, in all their equipment,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Very richly in every detail.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For trust well that dukes, earls, kings<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Were gathered in this noble company,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For love and for the benefit of chivalry.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;About this king there ran on all sides  <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Full many a tame lion and leopard.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And in this manner these lords, one and all,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Are come to the city on the Sunday <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;About nine a.m., and in the town dismounted.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This Theseus, this duke, this worthy knight,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When he had brought them into his city,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And provided them lodging, each one according to his rank,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He feasts them, and does such great labor<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To entertain them and do them all honor<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That people still believe that the wit of no man<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Of any rank could do better.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The music, the service at the feast,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The great gifts to every one,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The rich adornment of Theseus' palace,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nor who sat first nor last upon the dais,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;What ladies are fairest or best in dancing,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Or which of them can dance best and sing,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nor who speaks most feelingly of love;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;What hawks sit on the perch above,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;What hounds lie down on the floor --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I now make no mention of all this,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But (speak only) of the substance; that seems to me the best.		<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Now comes the point, and listen if you please.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Sunday night, before day began to spring,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When Palamon heard the lark sing<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(Although it was not day by two hours,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Yet sang the lark) and Palamon right then<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With pious heart and with a noble disposition,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He rose to go on his pilgrimage<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To the blessed gracious Citherea --	<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I mean Venus, honorable and worshipful.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And in her (planetary) hour he walks forth slowly<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Unto the lists where her temple was,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And down he kneels, and with humble expression<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And painful heart he said as you shall hear:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Fairest of the fair, O lady mine, Venus,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Daughter to Jove and spouse of Vulcan,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Thou maker of joy of the mount of Citheron,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For that same love thou haddest to Adonis,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Have pity on my bitter, smarting tears,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And take my humble prayer to thy heart.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Alas! I do not have any language to tell<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The effects nor the torments of my hell;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;My heart can not reveal my harms;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I am so befuddled that I can not say (anything)<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But `Mercy, lady bright, who knowest well<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;My thought and seest what harms I feel!'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Consider all this and have pity upon my pain,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As surely as I shall for evermore,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;According to my power (as much as I can), be thy true servant,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And make war always against chastity.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I make that my vow, providing you help me!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I care not to boast of arms <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nor do I ask to have victory tomorrow,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nor renown in this case, nor vain glory<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nor fame for deeds of arms proclaimed everywhere;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But I would have fully possession<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Of Emelye, and die in thy service.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Find thou the manner how and in what way:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I care not if it may better be<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To have victory over them, or they over me,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So that I have my lady in my arms.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For though it be true that Mars is god of arms,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Your power is so great in heaven above<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That if you please, I shall well have my love.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I will worship thy temple evermore,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And on thy altar, whether I ride or walk (whatever I do),<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I will do sacrifice and kindle fires.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And if you will not (do) so, my lady sweet,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Then I pray thee, tomorrow with a spear<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That Arcite stab me through the heart.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Then I care not, when I have lost my life,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Though Arcite win her to be his wife.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This is the substance and goal of my prayer:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Give me my love, thou blessed dear lady."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When the prayer of Palamon was done,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He did his sacrifice, and that quickly,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Full piteously, with all due ceremony,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Although I tell not now his observances;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But at the last the statue of Venus shook,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And made a sign, whereby he understood<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That his prayer was accepted that day.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For though the sign showed a delay,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Yet he knew well that his request was granted,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And with glad heart he went home very soon.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The third planetary hour after Palamon<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Began to go to Venus' temple,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Up rose the sun, and up rose Emelye<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And to the temple of Diana did hasten.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Her maidens, whom she led thither with her,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;They had the fire full readily with them,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The incense, the cloths, and all the rest<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That is needed for the sacrifice;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The horns full of mead, as was the custom --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There lacked nothing (needed) to do her sacrifice.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The temple smoking (with incense), full of fair cloths,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This Emelye, with gentle heart,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Washed her body with water of a well.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But how she did her rite I dare not tell,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Unless it be some thing in general; <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And yet it would be a pleasure to hear all.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To one who means well it would be no matter of concern;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But it is good for a man to be without restriction (speak freely).<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Her bright hair was combed, all loose;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A crown of an evergreen oak <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Was set upon her head full fair and suitable.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Two fires on the altar did she kindle,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And did her duties, as men can behold<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In Statius' <i>Thebaid</i> and such old books.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When the fire was kindled, with a pitiful expression<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Unto Diana she spoke as you may hear:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"O chaste goddess of the green woods,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To whom both heaven and earth and sea is visible,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Queen of the dark and low reign of Pluto,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Goddess of maidens, whom my heart hast known<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Full many a year, and knowest what I desire,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Keep me from thy vengeance and thy ire,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Which Acteon paid for cruelly.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Chaste goddess, well knowest thou that I<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Desire to be a maiden all my life,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nor never will I be no lover nor wife.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I am, thou knowest, yet of thy company,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A maiden, and love hunting and the chase,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And to walk in the wild woods,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And not to be a wife and be with child.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I do not desire to know company of man.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Now help me, lady, since you can and know how,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For those three forms that thou hast in thee.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And Palamon, that has such love to me,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And also Arcite, who loves me so painfully,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This grace I pray thee and ask no more,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Send love and peace between them two,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And turn away their hearts from me so<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That all their hot love and their desire,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And all their intense torment, and their fire<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Will be quenched, or turned to another place.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And if it so be thou wilt not do me grace,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Or if my destiny is shaped so<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That I must by necessity have one of them two,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Send me him who most desires me.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Behold, goddess of clean chastity,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The bitter tears that fall on my cheeks.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Since thou art maiden and guardian of us all,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Thou care for and well conserve my maidenhood,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And while I live, as a maiden I will serve thee."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The fires burn brightly upon the altar,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;While Emelye was thus in her prayer.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But suddenly she saw a curious sight,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For right away one of the fires quenched<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And rekindled again, and after that straightway<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That other fire was quenched and all gone;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And as it quenched it made a roaring sound,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As these wet brands do in their burning,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And at the brand's end (the fire) ran out straightway<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As if it were many bloody drops;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For which so sorely frightened was Emelye<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That she was well nigh mad and began to cry,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For she did not know what it signified,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But simply for fear has she cried thus,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And wept that it was a pity to hear.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And right then Diana did appear,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With bow in hand, just like a huntress,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And said, "Daughter, cease thy sadness.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Among the high gods it is affirmed,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And by eternal word written and confirmed,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Thou shalt be wedded unto one of those<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Who have for thee so much care and woe,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But unto which of them I may not tell.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Farwell, for I can stay no longer .<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The fires which burn on my altar <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Shall declare to thee, before thou go hence,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Thy destiny concerning love, as in this situation."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And with that word, the arrows in the quiver<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Of the goddess clatter fast and ring,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And forth she went and vanished;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For which this Emelye was astonished,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And said, "What does this mean, alas?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I put me in thy protection,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Diana, and in thy power."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And home she goes at once the nearest way.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This is the substance; there is no more to say.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The next (planetary) hour of Mars following this,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Arcite has walked unto the temple <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Of fierce Mars to do his sacrifice,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With all the rites of his pagan manner (of worship).<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With sorrowful heart and intense devotion,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Right thus to Mars he said his prayer:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"O strong god, who in the cold reigns <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Of Thrace art honored and considered lord,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And hast in every reign and every land<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;All the control of arms in thy hand,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And grants them fortune as it pleases thee to command.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Accept of me my sorrowful sacrifice.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;If it so be that my youth may deserve,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And that my power be worthy to serve<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Thy godhead, so that I may be one of thine,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Then pray I thee to have pity upon my pain.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For that same pain and that same hot fire<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In which thou once burned for desire,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When that thou enjoyed the beauty<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Of fair, young, fresh Venus the noble,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And haddest her in arms as you wished --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Although once things went wrong for you,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When Vulcan had caught thee in his snare<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And found thee lying by his wife, alas! --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For that same sorrow that was in thy heart,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Have pity as well upon my painful sufferings. <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I am young and ignorant, as thou knowest,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And, as I suppose, injured most by love <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Than ever was any living creature,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For she that causes me to endure all this woe <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nor cares never whether I sink or swim.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And well I know, before she may promise me mercy,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I must win her with strength in the lists,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And well I know, without help or grace<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Of thee my strength can not avail.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Then help me, lord, tomorrow in my battle,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For that same fire that once burned thee,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As well as that same fire now burns me,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And bring it about so that I have victory tomorrow.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mine be the labor, and thine be the glory!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I will most honor thy most excellent temple<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Over any place, and always most labor<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In thy pleasure and in thy strong crafts,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And in thy temple I will hang my banner <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And all the arms of my company,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And evermore, until that day I die,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Eternal fire I will provide before thee (on your altar).<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And also I will bind myself to this vow:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;My beard, my hair, that hangs long down,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That never yet felt injury<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Of razor nor of shears, I will give thee,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And be thy true servant while I live.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Now, lord, have pity upon my painful sorrows;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Give me victory; I ask of thee no more."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The prayer of Arcite the strong stopped,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The rings that hung on the temple door,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And also the doors, clattered very fast,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Of which Arcite was somewhat afraid.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The fires upon the altar burned (so) brightly <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That it began to illuminate all the temple;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A sweet smell the ground at once yielded up,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And Arcite immediately raised up his hand,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And he cast more incense into the fire,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With more other rites; and at the last<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The statue of Mars began to ring its coat of mail,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And with that sound he heard a murmuring<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Very low and faint, that said thus, "Victory!"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For which he (Arcite) gave to Mars honor and glory.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And thus with joy and hope to fare well<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Arcite at once is gone unto his lodging,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As happy as a fowl is for the bright sun.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And right away such strife there is begun,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Because of that same grant, in the heaven above, <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Between Venus, the goddess of love,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And Mars, the stern god powerful in arms,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That Jupiter was hard put to stop it,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Until the pale Saturn the hostile,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Who knew so many of old adventures,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Found in his old experience a plan<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That he full soon has pleased every side.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As is truly said, old age has a great advantage;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In old age is both wisdom and experience;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;One can outrun the old but not outwit them.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Saturn anon, to stop strife and fear,  <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Although it is against his natural disposition,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He found a remedy for all this strife.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"My dear daughter Venus," said Saturn,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"My orbit, that has so wide (a course) to turn,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Has more power than any man knows.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mine is the drowning in the sea so dark;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mine is the imprisonment in the dark cell;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mine is the killing and hanging by the throat,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The murmur (of discontent) and the churls' rebelling,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The grumbling, and the secret poisoning;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I exact vengeance and do full punishment,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;While I dwell in the (zodiacal) sign of the lion.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mine is the ruin of the high halls,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The falling of the towers and of the walls<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Upon the miner or the carpenter.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I slew Sampson, shaking the pillar;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And mine are the cold maladies,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The dark treasons, and the old plots;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;My (astrological) aspect is the father of pestilence.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Now weep no more; I shall do my diligence<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So that Palamon, who is thine own knight,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Shall have his lady, as thou hast promised him.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Though Mars shall help his knight, yet nonetheless<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Between you there must be peace sometime,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Although you are not of one (the same) temperament,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Which daily causes such dissension.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I am thy grandfather, ready (to do) as you wish;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Weep now no more; I will fulfill thy desire."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Now I will stop (speaking) of the gods above,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Of Mars, and of Venus, goddess of love,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And tell you as plainly as I can<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The essential part, for which I began.<BR>
