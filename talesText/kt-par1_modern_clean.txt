But briefly to tell is my intent.
When this worthy duke, this Theseus,
Has slain Creon and thus won Thebes,
Still in that field he took all night his rest,
And did with all the country as he pleased.
To search in the heap of dead bodies,
To strip them of armor and of clothing,
The scavengers took great pains and worked hard
After the battle and defeat.
And (it) so befell that in the heap they found,
Pierced through with many a grievous bloody wound,
Two young knights lying side by side,
Both with the same coat of arms, very richly wrought,
Of which two one was called Arcite,
And that other knight was called Palamon.
They were not fully alive, nor fully dead,
But by their coats of arms and by their equipment
The heralds best knew them in particular
As they that were of the royal blood 
Of Thebes, and born of two sisters.
The scavengers have pulled them out of the heap,
And have carried them softy unto the tent
Of Theseus; and he very soon sent them 
To Athens, to dwell in prison
Perpetually -- he would not (accept) any ransom.
And when this worthy duke has thus done,
He took his army, and home he rides straightway
As a conqueror crowned with laurel;
And there he lives in joy and in honor
For the duration of his life; what more words are needed?
And in a tower, in anguish and in woe,
This Palamon and his fellow Arcite
For evermore (remain); no gold can ransom them.
This passes year by year and day by day,
Until it befell once, in a morning of May,
That Emelye, who was fairer to be seen 
Than is the lily upon its green stalk,
And fresher than the May with new flowers --
For her hue vied with color of the rose,
I do not know which was the finer of them two --
Before it was day, as was her custom to do,
She was arisen and all ready prepared,
For May will have no laziness at night.
The season urges on every gentle heart,
And makes it out of its sleep to awake suddenly,
And says "Arise, and do thy observance."
This made Emelye remember
To do honor to May, and to rise.
She was gaily clothed, so to say:
Her yellow hair was braided in a tress
Behind her back, a yard long, I guess.
And in the garden, at the rising of the sun,
She walks up and down, and as she pleases
She gathers flowers, mixed white and red,
To make an intricate garland for her head;
And she sang (as) heavenly as an angel.
The great tower, that was so thick and strong,
Which was the main fortification of the castle
(Where the knights were in prison
Of which I told yow and shall tell),
Was just next to the garden wall
Where this Emelye took her pleasure.
The sun was bright and clear that morning,
And Palamon, this woeful prisoner,
As was his custom, by permission of his jailer,
Had risen and roamed in a chamber on high,
In which he saw all the noble city,
And also the garden, full of green branches,
Where this fresh Emelye the bright
Was in her walk, and roamed up and down.
This sorrowful prisoner, this Palamon,
Goes in the chamber roaming to and fro
And to himself lamenting his woe.
That he was born, full often he said, "alas!"
And so it happened, by chance or accident,
That through a window, thickly set with many a bar
Of iron, great and square as any beam,
He cast his eye upon Emelye,
And with that he turned pale and cried, "A!"
As though he were stabbed unto the heart.
And with that cry Arcite immediately leaped up 
And said, "My cousin, what ails thee,
Who art so pale and deadly to look upon?
Why didst thou cry out? Who has done thee offence?
For the love of God, take all in patience
Our imprisonment, for it may not be otherwise.
Fortune has given us this adversity.
Some wicked aspect or disposition
Of Saturn, by some arrangement of the heavenly bodies,
Has given us this, although we had sworn it would not be;
So stood the heavens when we were born.
We must endure it; this is the short and plain."
This Palamon answered and said in reply,
"Cousin, truly, concerning this opinion
Thou hast a foolish conception.
This prison did not cause me to cry out,
But I was hurt right now through my eye
Into my heart, so that it will be the death of me.
The fairness of that lady whom I see
Yonder in the garden roaming to and fro
Is cause of all my crying and my woe.
I know not whether she is woman or goddess,
But truly it is Venus, as I suppose."
And with that he fell down on his knees,
And said, "Venus, if it be thy will
Thus to transfigure yourself in this garden 
Before me, sorrowful, wretched creature,
Help that we may escape out of this prison.
And if it be so that my destiny is shaped
By eternal decree to die in prison,
Have some compassion on our (noble) lineage
Which is brought so low by tyranny."
And with that word Arcite did see
Where this lady roamed to and fro,
And with that sight her beauty hurt him so,
That, if Palamon was sorely wounded,
Arcite is hurt as much as he, or more.
And with a sigh he said piteously,
"The fresh beauty slays me suddenly
Of her who roams in the yonder place;
And unless I have her mercy and her grace,
So that I can at least see her, 
I am as good as dead; there is no more to say."
This Palamon, when he heard those words,
Angrily he looked and answered,
"Sayest thou this in earnest or in play?"
"Nay," said Arcite, "in earnest, by my faith!
So help me God, I have no desire to play."
This Palamon did knit his two brows.
"It would not be," said he, "any great honor to thee 
To be false, nor to be traitor
To me, who am thy cousin and thy brother
Sworn very sincerely, and each of us to the other,
That never, though we had to die by torture,
Until death shall part us two,
Neither of us in love (is) to hinder the other,
Nor in any other case, my dear brother,
But rather thou shouldest truly help me
In every case, as I shall help thee --
This was thy oath, and mine also, certainly;
I know right well, thou darest not deny it.
Thus thou art my trusted confidant, without doubt,
And now thou wouldest falsely be busy preparing 
To love my lady, whom I love and serve,
And ever shall until my heart dies.
Nay, certainly, false Arcite, thou shalt not (do) so.
I loved hire first, and told thee my woe
As to my confidant and my sworn brother 
To further me, as I have told before.
For which thou art bound as a knight
To help me, if it lay in thy power,
Or else thou art false, I dare well say."
This Arcite full proudly spoke in return:
"Thou shalt," said he, "be rather false than I;
And thou art false, I tell thee flatly,
As a mistress I loved her first before thou.
What wilt thou say? Thou knowest not yet now
Whether she is a woman or goddess!
Thine is a feeling of holiness,
And mine is love as to a creature;
For which I told thee my circumstance
As to my cousin and my sworn brother.
I posit (this assumption): that thou lovedest her first;
Knowest thou not well the old clerks' saying,
That `who shall give a lover any law?'
Love is a greater law, by my skull,
Than may be given to any earthly man;
And therefore positive (man-made) law and such decree
Is broken every day for love in every way.
A man must of necessity love, in spite of all he can do;
He can not flee (from) it, though he should be dead,
Whether she be maid, or widow, or else wife.
And also it is not likely all thy life
To stand in her good graces; no more shall I;
For well thou thyself knowest, truly,
That thou and I are condemned to prison
Perpetually; no ransom can help us.
We strive as the hounds did for the bone;
They fought all day, and yet their share was nothing.
There came a kite, while they were so angry,
And carried away the bone between them both.
And therefore, at the king's court, my brother,
Each man for himself, there is no other (way).
Love, if it please thee, for I love and always shall;
And truly, dear brother, this is all.
Here in this prison we must endure,
And each one of us take his chance."
Great and long was the strife between them two,
If I had leisure to tell (it);
But to the point. It happened on a day,
To tell it to you as briefly as I can,
A worthy duke that was called  Perotheus,
Who was  a friend to duke Theseus
Since that same time that they were little children,
Had come to Athens to visit his friend,
And to amuse himself as he was accustomed to do;
For in this world he loved no man so (much),
And he (Theseus) loved him as tenderly in turn.
So well they loved, as old books say,
That when one was dead, truly to tell,
His friend went and sought him down in hell --
But of that story I do not desire to write.
Duke Perotheus loved well Arcite,
And had known him at Thebes year after year,
And finally at request and prayer
Of Perotheus, without any ransom,
Duke Theseus let him out of prison
Freely to go all over, wherever he wishes,
In such a manner as shall I tell you.
This was the agreement, plainly to write,
Between Theseus and this Arcite:
That if it so were that Arcite were found
Ever in his life, by day or night, at any moment
In any country of this Theseus,
And if he were caught, it was agreed thus,
That with a sword he should lose his head.
There was no other remedy nor course of action;
But (he) takes his leave, and homeward he sped.
Let him be ware! His neck lies as a pledge.
How great a sorrow now suffers Arcite!
He feels the death smite through his heart;
He weeps, wails, cries piteously;
To slay himself he secretly awaits (an opportunity).
He said, "Alas that day that I was born!
Now my prison is worse than before;
Now I am destined eternally to dwell
Not in purgatory, but in hell.
Alas, that ever I knew Perotheus!
For else I would have remained with Theseus,
Fettered in his prison evermore.
Then would I have been in bliss and not in woe.
Only the sight of her whom I serve,
Though I never can deserve her grace,
Would have sufficed right enough for me.
O dear cousin Palamon," said he,
"The victory of this adventure is thine.
Very blissfully in prison thou can remain --
In prison? Certainly not, but in paradise!
Well has Fortune turned the dice for thee,
That hast the sight of her, and I the absence.
For it is possible, since thou hast her presence,
And art a knight, a worthy and an able (one),
That by some chance, since Fortune is changeable,
Thou mayest sometime attain thy desire.
But I, who am exiled and barren
Of all grace, and in so great despair
That there is not earth, water, fire, nor air,
Nor creature that is made of them,
That can help me or do comfort (to me) in this,
Well ought I to die in despair and distress.
Farwell my life, my desire, and my gladness!
"Alas, why do folk so commonly complain 
About the providence of God, or of Fortune,
That gives them full often in many a manner
Much better than they can themselves imagine?
One man desires to have riches,
Which is the cause of his murder or great sickness;
And one man would happily (go) out of his prison,
Who is slain in his house by members of his household.
Infinite harms are in this matter.
We know not what thing we pray for here;
We act like one who is drunk as a mouse.
A drunk man knows well he has a house,
But he does not know which is the right way to it,
And to a drunk man the way is slippery.
And certainly, so we fare in this world;
We seek eagerly after felicity,
But we go wrong very often, truly.
Thus can we all say, and especially I,
Who supposed and had a firm belief
That if I might escape from prison,
Then I would have been in joy and perfect well-being,
Whereas now I am exiled from my source of happiness.
Since I can not see you, Emelye,
I am as good as dead; there is not any remedy."
Upon that other side Palamon,
When he knew Arcite was gone,
He makes such sorrow that the great tour
Resounds with his yowling and clamor.
The great fetters themselves on his shins 
Were wet from his bitter, salt tears.
"Alas," said he, "Arcite, cousin mine,
Of all our strife, God knows, the profit is thine.
Thou walkest freely now in Thebes,
And thou care little about my woe.
Thou mayest, since thou hast wisdom and manhood,
Assemble all the folk of our family,
And make a war so sharp on this city
That by some chance or some treaty
Thou mayest have her as lady and as wife
For whom I must of necessity lose my life.
For, as by way of possibility,
Since thou art at thy liberty, free of prison,
And art a lord, thy advantage is great,
More than is mine, who die here in a cage.
For I must weep and wail, while I live,
With all the woe that prison may give me,
And also with pain that love gives me also,
That doubles all my torment and my woe."
With that the fire of jealousy started up
Within his breast, and seized him by the heart
So madly that he was to look upon like 
The box tree or the ash dead and cold.
Then said he, "O cruel gods that govern
This world with binding of your eternal word,
And write in the table of adamant (hardest of stones)
Your decision and your eternal decree,
Why is mankind more obligated unto you 
Than is the sheep that cowers in the sheepfold?
For man is slain exactly like another beast,
And dwells also in prison and detention,
And has sickness and great adversity,
And often times guiltless, indeed.
"What (sort of) governance is in this foreknowledge,
That torments guiltless innocence?
And yet this increases all my suffering,
That man is bound to his duty,
For God's sake, to refrain from his desire,
Whereas a beast may fulfill all his desire.
And when a beast is dead he has no pain;   
But man after his death must weep and lament,
Though in this world he may have (had) care and woe.
Without doubt such is the case.
The answer to this I leave to theologians,
But well I know that great pain is in this world.
Alas, I see a serpent or a thief,
That has done mischief to many a true man,
Go at his liberty, and can go where he pleases.
But I must be in prison because of Saturn,
And also because of Juno, jealous and also mad,
Who has destroyed well nigh all the blood
Of Thebes with its wide devastated walls;
And Venus slays me on that other side
For jealousy and fear of this Arcite."
Now will I cease (speaking of) of Palamon for a little while,
And leave him to dwell in his prison still,
And of Arcite forth I will tell you.
The summer passes, and the long nights 
Increase doubly the strong pains 
Both of the lover and the prisoner.
I know not which has the more woeful task.
For, briefly to say (it), this Palamon
Is damned perpetually to prison,
In chains and in fetters to be dead;
And Arcite is exiled on threat of losing his head
For evermore, out of that country,
Nor nevermore shall see his lady.
Yow lovers now I ask this question:
Who has the worse, Arcite or Palamon?
That one may see his lady every day,
But in prison he must always dwell;
That other where he pleases may ride or walk,
But he shall see his lady nevermore.
Now judge as it pleases you, you who know (of such things),
For I will tell forth as I began.
