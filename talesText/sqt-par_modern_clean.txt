[The first part ends.] 
[The second part follows.] 
I saw never ere now no bird nor beast
That treated himself so piteously.
You slay me with your sorrow truly,
I have of you such great compassion.
For God's love, come down from the tree;
And as I am a king's daughter true,
If that I truly knew the cause
Of your malady, if it lay in my power,
I would amend it ere it were night,
So help me great God of nature!
And herbs shall I in abundance find
With which to heal your hurts quickly."
Then shrieked this falcon yet more pitifully
Than ever she did, and fell to ground straightway,
And lies in a swoon, dead and like a stone,
Until Canacee has in her lap her taken
Until the time she awoke from the swoon.
And after she started up from her swoon,
Right in her hawk's language thus she said:
"That pity runs soon in a gentle heart,
Feeling its counterpart in sharp pains,
Is proven every day, as men may it see,
As well by deeds as by written authority;
For a gentle heart makes known its noble character.
I see well that you have of my distress
Compassion, my faire Canacee,
Out of true womanly goodness
That Nature in your natural disposition has set.
But for no hope to fare the better,
But to obey unto your heart noble,
And to make others be warned by my example,
As by the whelp chastised is the lion,
Right for that cause and to that conclusion,
While that I have the time and the opportunity,
My harm I will reveal ere I go away."
And ever, while that one her sorrow told,
That other wept as she would turn to water
Until the falcon prayed her to be still,
And, with a sigh, right thus she spoke her mind:
"Where I was bred -- alas, that same day! --
And fostered on a cliff of marble gray
So tenderly that no thing ailed me,
I knew not what was adversity
Until I could fly full high under the sky.
Then dwelt a male falcon very near me,
That seemed an exemplar of all nobility;
Although he was full of treason and falseness,
It was so concealed under humble bearing,
And under the appearance of truth in such a manner,
Under pleasantness, and under careful attentiveness,
That no creature could have supposed he could feign,
So deeply in a fast dye he dyed his true colors.
Just as a serpent hides himself under flowers
Until he can see his time to bite,
Just so this god of love's hypocrite
So does his ceremonies and obeisances,
And keeps in outward appearance all his observances
That are in accord with nobility in love.
As in a tomb all the beauty is above,
And under is the corpse, as you know,
Such was this hypocrite, in every circumstance.
And in this manner he served his own purpose
So that, except for the fiend, no one knew what he meant,
Until he so long had wept and complained,
And many a year his service to me feigned,
Until my heart, too compassionate and too naive,
Entirely ignorant of his consummate malice,
Very frightened that he might die, as it seemed to me,
Upon receiving his oaths and his pledges,
Granted him love, upon this condition,
That evermore my honor and renown
Were safe, both in private and in public (in all ways);
This is to say, that according to his deserts,
I gave him all my heart and all my thought --
God knows and he, I would not have agreed on any other terms --
And took his heart in exchange for mine for ever.
But truly it is said, since many a day gone by,
`An honest creature and a thief think not alike.'
And when he saw the business so far advanced
That I had granted him fully my love
In such a manner as I have said above,
And gave him my true heart as freely
As he swore he gave his heart to me,
Immediately
Fell on his knees with such devout humility,
With such high reverence, and, as seemed by his appearance,
So like a gentle lover in his manners,
So ravished, as it seemed, for the joy
That never Jason nor Paris of Troy --
Jason? certainly, nor any other man
Since Lameth was, he who first of all began
To love two, as folk wrote long ago --
Nor ever, since the first man was born,
Could (any) man, by (so much as) one twenty thousandth,
Reproduce the deceptive sophisms of his art,
Nor were worthy to unbuckle his galosh,
Where duplicity or feigning were concerned,
Nor so could thank a creature as he did to me!
His manner was a heaven to see
For any woman, were she never so wise,
So painted he and made himself elegant in every way,
Both his words and his countenance.
And I so loved him for his obeisance,
And for the truth I believed was in his heart,
That if it so were that any thing pained him,
Although it were never so little, and I knew of it,
It seemed to me I felt death twist my heart.
And shortly, this business had gone forth so far
That my will was his will's instrument;
This is to say, my will obeyed his will
In all things, so far as was consonant with reason,
Keeping ever the limits set by my honor.
Nor never loved anyone more, or even as much
As him, God knows, nor never shall again.
"This lasted longer than a year or two,
That I supposed of him nothing but good.
But finally, thus at the last it stood,
That Fortune would have it that he must depart
Out of that place where I was.
Whether I was woeful, there is no question;
I can not make a description of it.
For one thing I dare tell boldly:
By this experience I know what is the pain of death;
Such harm I felt because he could not remain.
So one day he took his leave of me,
So sorrowfully also that I believed truly
That he had felt as much harm as I,
When I heard him speak and saw his appearance.
But nevertheless, I thought he was so true,
And also that he should return again
Within a little while, to say the truth;
And it was reasonable also that he must go
For his honor, as often it happens so,
So that I made virtue of necessity,
And took it well, since it had to be.
As I best could, I hid from him my sorrow,
And took him by the hand, with Saint John as my guarantor,
And said to him thus: `Lo, I am all yours;
Be to me such as I to you have been and shall be.'
What he answered, it needs not be repeated;
Who can speak better than he, who can act worse?
When he has said everything well, then he has done (all he will do).
`Therefore she must have a very long spoon
Who shall eat with a fiend,' thus I have heard said.
So at the last he had to go forth on his way,
And forth he speeds until he came where he pleased.
When he decided to rest,
I believe he had that text in mind,
That `every thing, by returning to its natural state,
Makes himself happy;' thus say men, as I suppose.
Men, because of their nature, love novelty,
As do birds that men feed in cages.
For though thou take care of them night and day,
And strew their cages with straw fair and soft as silk,
And give them sugar, honey, bread and milk,
Yet just as soon as his door is left open
He with his feet will kick down his cup,
And to the wood he will go and eat worms;
They are so fond of novelty in their food,
And love novelties because of their nature,
No nobility of blood can restrain them.
"So fared this falcon, alas the day!
Though he was of noble birth, and fresh and gay,
And goodly to look upon and humble and generous,
He saw upon a time a kite (scavenger bird) fly by,
And suddenly he so loved this kite
That all his love is completely gone from me,
And has turned his truth false in this manner.
Thus has the kite my lover in her service,
And I am lost, without remedy!"
And with that word this falcon did cry out
And swooned again in Canacee's lap.
Great was the sorrow for the hawk's harm
That Canacee and all her women made;
They knew not how they might cheer up the falcon.
But Canacee carries her home enfolded in her gown,
And softly did wrap her in bandages,
Where she with her beak had hurt herself.
Now Canacee can do nothing but dig herbs
Out of the ground, and make new salves
Of herbs, precious and delicate in color,
With which to heal this hawk. From dawn to nighttime
She devotes her efforts and all her power,
And by her bed's head she made a pen
And covered it with velvet cloths, blue
As a sign of truth that is in women seen.
And on all the outside, the pen is painted green,
In which were painted all these false fowls,
Such as are these small birds, falcons, and owls;
For sheer scorn were painted beside them,
Magpies, to cry out against them and chide them.
Thus I leave Canacee keeping her hawk;
I will for now speak no more of her ring
Until it becomes again appropriate to tell
How this falcon got back her love,
Repentant, as the story tells us,
By the mediation of Cambalus,
The king's son, of whom I told you.
But henceforth I will keep to my narrative
To speak of adventures and of battles
That never yet were heard such great marvels.
First will I tell you of Cambyuskan,
That in his time many a city won;
And after I will speak of Algarsif,
How he won Theodora to his wife,
For whom full often in great peril he was,
Had he not been helped by the steed of brass;
And next I will speak of Cambalo,
That fought in lists with the brethren two
For Canacee ere he could win her.
And where I left off I will again begin.

Appollo whirls up his chariot so high
To that house of the god Mercury, the sly --
"In faith, Squire, thou hast well acquitted thyself.
And nobly. I praise well thy intelligence,"
Said the Franklin, "considering thy youth,
With such feeling thou speakest, sir, I praise thee!
In my opinion, there is no one that is here
That shall be thy equal in eloquence,
If thou live; God give thee good luck,
And in virtue send thee perseverance,
For I take great pleasure in thy speech.
I have a son, and by the Trinity,
I had rather than have twenty pound's worth of land,
Though it right now were fallen in my hand,
That he were a man of such discretion
As you are! Fie on possessions,
Unless a man is virtuous as well!
I have rebuked my son, and shall again,
Because he has no desire to devote himself to virtue;
But to play at dice, and to spend
And lose all that he has is his usage.
And he would rather talk with a serving boy
Than converse with any noble person
From whom he might learn true nobility."
"Straw for your nobility!" said our Host.
"What, Franklin! By God, sir, well thou knowest
That each of you must tell at the least
A tale or two, or break his promise."
"That know I well, sir," said the Franklin.
"I pray you, hold me not in disdain,
Though to this man I speak a word or two."
"Tell on thy tale without more words."
"Gladly, sir Host," said he, "I will obey
Unto your will; now hearken what I say.
I will not offend you in any way
So far as my mental abilities will suffice.
I pray to God that it may please you;
Then I will know well that it is good enough."
