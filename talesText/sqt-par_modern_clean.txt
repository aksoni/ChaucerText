"Squire, come nearer, if it be your will,
And say something about love, for certainly you
Know as much about that as any man."
"Nay, sir," said he, "but I will speak as I can
With a hearty will, for I will not rebel
Against your desire; a tale I will tell.
Have me excused if I speak amiss;
My will is good, and lo, my tale is this."
At Sarray, in the land of Tartars,
There dwelt a king who waged war on Russia,
Through which there died many a doughty man.
This noble king was called Cambyuskan,
Who in his time was of such great renown
That there was nowhere in any region
So excellent a lord in all things:
He lacked nothing that is appropriate to a king.
In accord with the religion in which he was born
He kept its law, to which he was sworn;
And moreover he was hardy, wise, and rich,
And compassionate and just, always impartial;
Truthful of his word, benign, and honorable;
Of his heart as stable as the center of any circle;
Young, vigorous, and strong, in arms as desirous (to excel)
As any young knight of all his household.
He was a handsome person and fortunate,
And always so well maintained the splendor appropriate to his rank
That there was nowhere such another man.
This noble king, this Tartar Cambyuskan,
Had two sons on Elpheta his wife,
Of whom the eldest was called Algarsyf;
That other son was called Cambalo.
A daughter had this worthy king also,
That youngest was, and was called Canacee.
But to tell you all her beauty,
It lies not in my tongue, nor in my abilities;
I dare not undertake so high a thing.
My English also is insufficient.
He must be an excellent rhetorician
Who knows his figures of speech appropriate to that art,
If he should describe her in every detail.
I am none such, I must speak as I can.
And it so befell that when this Cambyuskan
Has twenty winters borne his diadem,
As he was accustomed from year to year, I suppose,
He had the feast of his nativity
Proclaimed throughout Sarray his city,
Exactly March 15, in the ordinary course of the year.
Phoebus the sun full jolly was and clear,
For he was near his position of greatest power
In Mars' face and in his astrological house
In Aries, the choleric hot sign.
Full pleasant was the weather and mild,
For which the fowls, in response to the bright sun,
What for the season and the young greenery,
Full loudly sang of their desires.
They seemed to have gotten themselves protections
Against the sword of winter, keen and cold.
This Cambyuskan, of whom I have you told,
In royal vestments sits on his dais,
With diadem, full nobly in his palace,
And holds his feast so solemn and so rich
That in this world there was none like it;
Of which if I should tell all the festivities,
Then would it occupy a summer's day,
And also it is not necessary to describe
At every course the order of their service.
I will not tell of their strange stews,
Nor of their swans, nor of their young herons.
Also in that land, as old knights tell,
There is some food that is considered very delicious
That in this land is reckoned of but little value;
There is no man that can report all.
I will not tarry you, for it is nine a.m.
And because it is not essential to the tale but a loss of time;
Unto my first topic I will return.
And so it befell that after the third course,
While this king sits thus in his nobility,
Listening to his minstrels playing their instruments
Before him at the table delightfully,
In at the hall door all suddenly
There came a knight upon a steed of brass,
And in his hand a broad mirror of glass.
Upon his thumb he had of gold a ring,
And by his side a naked sword hanging;
And up he rides to the high table.
In all the hall there was not spoken a word
For marveling at this knight; him to behold
Full intently they gaze, young and old.
This strange knight, who came thus suddenly,
All armed, except his head, full richly,
Salutes king and queen and all the lords,
In the order in which they sat in the hall,
With such high reverence and respect,
As well in speech as in countenance,
That Gawain, with his old courtesy,
Though he were come again out of Fairyland,
Could not amend one word of his speech.
And after this, before the high table,
He with a manly voice said his message,
In accordance with the form used in his language,
Without one mistake of syllable or of letter;
And in order that his tale should seem the better,
Conforming to his words was his facial expression,
As teaches the art of speech to those who learn it.
Although I can not imitate his style,
Nor can not climb over so high a stile,
Yet say I this, as to his general meaning:
Thus much amounts all that ever he meant (to say),
If it so be that I have it (correctly) in mind.
He said, "The king of Araby and of India,
My liege lord, on this solemn day
Salutes you, as he best knows how and can,
And sends you, in honor of your feast,
By me, who am all ready to obey your command,
This steed of brass, that easily and well
Can in the space of one natural day --
This is to say, in four and twenty hours --
Where-ever you desire, in drought or else showers,
Bear your body into every place
To which your heart wishes to go,
Without harm to you, through foul or fair;
Or, if you desire to fly as high in the air
As does an eagle when he desires to soar,
This same steed shall bear you ever more,
Without harm, until you be where you wished,
Though you sleep or rest on his back,
And return again with twisting of a peg.
He who made it knew full many an ingenious contrivance.
He observed many a configuration of the stars
Before he had finished this operation,
And knew full many a magical seal and many a controlling force.
"This mirror also, that I have in my hand,
Has such a power that men can in it see
When there shall befall any adversity
Unto your reign or to yourself also,
And clearly who is your friend or foe.
"And in addition to all this, if any fair lady
Has set her heart on any sort of creature,
If he be false, she shall his treason see,
His new love, and all his trickery,
So clearly that there shall no thing be hidden.
For this reason, (to protect) against this amorous spring time,
This mirror and this ring, that you can see,
He has sent to my lady Canacee,
Your excellent daughter that is here.
"The power of the ring, if you will hear,
Is this: that if she wishes to wear it
Upon her thumb or bear it in her purse,
There is no fowl that flies under the heaven
That she shall not well understand his speech,
And know his meaning openly and plain,
And answer him in his language in reply;
And every herb that grows upon root
She shall also know, and to whom it will provide a remedy,
Although his wounds be ever so deep and wide.
"This naked sword, that hangs by my side,
Such power has that whatever man you smite
Throughout his armor it will carve and bite,
Were it as thick as is a branched oak;
And whatever man that is wounded by the stroke
Shall never be whole until you please, out of kindness,
To stroke him with the flat side in that same place
Where he is hurt; this is as much to say,
You must with the blunt side of the sword again
Stroke him in the wound, and it will close.
This is a very truth, without lying;
It fails not while it is in your possesion."
And when this knight has thus his tale told,
He rides out of hall and down he alit.
His steed, which shone like the bright sun,
Stands in the court, still as any stone.
This knight is to his chamber led straightway,
And is unarmed, and set to dinner.
The presents are full royally fetched --
This is to say, the sword and the mirror --
And carried straightway into the high tower
By certain officers appointed for this purpose;
And unto Canacee this ring is carried
Solemnly, where she sits at the table.
But truly, without any lie,
The horse of brass, that can not be moved,
It stands as if it were glued to the ground.
No man there can drive it out of the place
Despite any contrivance of windlass or pulley;
And the reason why? Because they do not know the craft.
And therefore in the place they have it left
Until the knight has taught them the manner
To remove him, as you shall later hear.
Great was the crowd that swarms to and fro
To stare on this horse that stands so,
For it
So well proportioned to be strong,
Exactly as if it were a steed of Lombardy;
In
As if it were a noble Apulian courser.
For certainly, from his tail unto his ear
Nature nor art could him not amend
To any extent, as all the people believed.
But evermore their greatest wonder was
How it could move, and yet was of brass;
It was from fairyland, as it seemed to the people.
Diverse folk diversely they deemed;
As many heads, as many opinions there are.
They murmured as does a swarm of bees,
And made arguments according to their fantasies,
Retelling these old poems,
And said it was like the Pegasus,
The hors that had wings in order to fly;
Or else it was Sinon the Greek's horse,
That brought Troy to destruction,
As men in these old romances read.
"My heart," said one, "is evermore in dread;
I believe some men of arms are in there,
That prepare themselves to conquer this city.
It would be very good if all such things were known."
Another whispered to his fellow quietly,
And said, "He lies, for it is rather like
An illusion made by some magic,
Such as conjurers play at these great feasts."
Of various conjectures thus they chatter and debate,
As ignorant people speculate commonly
Of things that are made more subtly
Than they in their ignorance can comprehend;
They habitually suppose the worse.
And some of them wondered about the mirror,
That was carried up into the principal tower,
How men might in it see such things.
Another answered and said it might well be
Naturally, by arrangements
Of angles and of ingenious reflections,
And said that in Rome was such a one.
They speak of Alocen, and Vitulon,
And Aristotle, that wrote while they lived
Of intricate mirrors and of optical lenses,
As know they who have heard their books (read aloud).
And other folk have wondered on the sword
That would pierce throughout every thing,
And fell in speech of Thelophus the king,
And of Achilles with his magical spear,
For he could with it both heal and harm,
Exactly in such a way as men may do with the sword
Of which right now you have yourselves heard.
They speak of various ways of hardening of metal,
And speak of chemicals moreover,
And how and when it should be hardened,
Which is unknown, at least unto me.
Then they speak of Canacee's ring,
And all said that such a wondrous thing
Of the craft of making rings they never heard anything,
Save that he Moses and king Solomon
Had a reputation for cunning in such art.
Thus say the people and draw themselves aside.
But nonetheless some said that it was
Wondrous to make glass out of ashes of fern,
And yet glass is not like ashes of fern;
But, because they have known it so long,
Therefore ceases their chattering and their wonder.
As intensely some wonder about the cause of thunder,
About ebb tide, about flood tide, about spider webs, and about mist,
And all things, until the cause is known.
Thus they chatter, and conjecture, and speculate
Until the king did from the table arise.
Phebus (the sun) has left the noon-time angle,
And yet ascending was the beast royal,
The noble Lion, with his star Aldiran,
When this Tarter king, Cambyuskan,
Rose from his table, where he sat full high.
Before him goes the loud music
Until he came to his chamber of tapestries (Presence Chamber),
Where they sound diverse instruments
That it is like a heaven to hear.
Now dance lusty Venus's children dear,
For in the Fish (Pisces) their lady sat full high,
And looks on them with a friendly eye.
This noble king is set upon his throne.
This foreign knight is fetched to him right away,
And on the dance he goes with Canacee.
Here is the revel and the jollity
That a dull-witted man is not able to describe.
He must have known love and its service
And be a convivial man as gay as May,
That should describe for you such splendor.
Who could tell you the form of dances
So strange, and such cheerful countenances,
Such subtle looking and dissimulations
For dread of jealous men's perceptions?
No man but Launcelot, and he is dead.
Therefore I pass over all this pleasure;
I say no more, but in this jollity
I leave them until people go to the supper.
The steward ordered the spiced cakes to be brought quickly,
And also the wine, amid all this music.
The ushers and the squires are gone,
The spiced cakes and the wine are come quickly.
They eat and drink, and when this had an end,
Unto the temple, as was reasonable, they wend.
The service done, they sup all day long.
What need is there to tell you their splendor?
Each man knows well that a king's feast
Has plenty for the highest ranks and for the lowest,
And dainties more than are in my knowing.
At after-supper goes this noble king
To see this horse of brass, with all in a crowd
Of lords and of ladies about him.
Such wondering was there about this horse of brass
That since the great siege of Troy was,
Where men wondered about a horse also,
Nor was there such a wondering as was then.
But finally the king asks this knight
About the power of this courser and the might,
And prayed him to tell how to control him.
This horse at once began to trip and dance,
When this knight laid hand upon his rein,
And said, "Sir, there is no more to say,
But, when you desire to ride anywhere,
You must turn a peg, which stands in his ear,
Which I shall you tell between us two(secretly).
You must name him to what place also,
Or to what country, that you want to ride.
And when you come where you desire to abide,
Bid him descend, and turn another peg,
For therein lies the essence of working the device,
And he will down descend and do your will,
And in that place he will abide still.
Though all the world the contrary had sworn,
He shall not thence be drawn nor carried away.
Or, if you wish to bid him go thence,
Turn this peg, and he will vanish at once
Out of the sight of every sort of creature,
And come again, be it by day or night,
When you wish to call him again
In such a manner as I shall to you say
Between you and me, and that very soon.
Ride when you wish; there is nothing more to do."
When the king was informed by that knight,
And has correctly understood
The manner and the form of all this matter,
Full glad and blithe, this noble doughty king
Returns to his revel as before.
The bridle is carried unto the tower
And kept among his jewels precious and dear.
The horse vanished, I know not in what manner,
Out of their sight; you get no more from me.
But thus I leave in pleasure and jollity
This Cambyuskan entertaining his lords
Until well nigh the day began to spring.
