A young man called Melibeus, mighty and rich, begot upon his wife, who was called Prudence,<br>
a daughter who was called Sophie.<br>
Upon one day it happened that he for his pleasure went into the fields to amuse himself.<br>
His wife and also his daughter has he left within his house of which the doors were tightly shut.<br>
Three of his old foes have seen this, and set ladders to the walls of his house,<br>
and by windows have entered,<br>
and beat his wife, and wounded his daughter with five mortal wounds in five different places --<br>
this is to say, in her feet, in her hands, in her ears, in her nose,<br>
and in her mouth -- and left her for dead, and went away.<br>
When Melibeus had returned into his house, and saw all this mischief, he,<br>
like a mad man tearing his clothes, began to weep and cry.<br>
Prudence, his wife, insofar as she dared, besought him to stop his weeping. <br>
but nevertheless he began to cry and the longer he wept the more he wept.<br>
This noble wife Prudence remembered the saying of Ovid, in his book<br>
that is called the Remedy of Love, where he says<br>
"He is a fool that stops the mother from weeping on the death of her child<br>
until she has wept her fill as for a certain time,<br>
and then shall one do his best efforts with amiable words to comfort her,<br>
and pray her of her weeping to stint."</b><br>
For which reason this noble wife Prudence allowed her husband<br>
to weep and cry as for a certain amount of time,<br>
and when she saw her opportunity, she said to him in this manner:<br>
"Alas, my lord," said she, "why do you make yourself to be like a fool?<br>
For truly it does not befit a wise man to make such a sorrow.<br>
Your daughter, with the grace of God, shall recover and escape.<br>
And, even if it were so that she right now were dead,<br>
you ought not, for her death, to destroy yourself.<br>
Seneca says: `The wise man shall not take too great discomfort for the death of his children,<br>
but, certainly, he should suffer it in patience<br>
as well as he abides the death of his own self.'"<br>
This Melibeus answered immediately and said, "What man," said he, "should stint of his weeping <br>
who has such a good reason to weep?<br>
Jesus Christ, our Lord, himself wept for the death of Lazarus his friend."<br>
Prudence answered: "Certainly, I know well that moderate weeping is in no way forbidden to him who is sorrowful,<br>
amongst folk in sorrow, but it is rather granted to him to weep.<br>
The Apostle Paul unto the Romans writes, `One shall rejoice<br>
with those who make joy and weep with such folk as weep.'<br>
But though moderate weeping is granted, excessive weeping certainly is forbidden.<br>
Moderation in weeping should be considered in the light of the lore that Seneca teaches us:<br>
`When thy friend is dead,' said he, `let not thine eyes be too moist of tears,<br>
nor too much dry; although the tears come to thine eyes, let them not fall;<br>
and when thou hast lost thy friend, make an effort to get another friend; <br>
and this is more wisdom than to weep for thy friend<br>
whom thou hast lost, for therein is no remedy.'<br>
And therefore, if you govern yourself by wisdom, put away sorrow out of your heart.<br>
Remember you that Jesus son of Sirach says, `A man that is joyous and glad in heart,<br>
it conserves him flourishing in his age; but truly sorrowful heart makes his bones dry.'<br>
He says also thus, that sorrow in heart slays very many a man.<br>
Solomon says that just as moths in the sheep's fleece do harm to the clothes,<br>
and the small worms to the tree, just so sorrow does harm to the heart.<br>
Wherefore we should, as well in the death of our children<br>
as in the loss of our other earthly goods, have patience.<br>
Remember the patient Job. When he had lost his children and his earthly property,<br>
and in his body endured and received very many a grievous tribulation, yet said he thus:<br>
`Our Lord has given it to me; our Lord hath taken it from me; just as our Lord wished,<br>
just so it is done; blessed be the name of our Lord!'"<br>
To these foresaid things answered Melibeus unto his wife Prudence: "All thy words," said he, <br>
"are true and furthermore beneficial, but truly my heart is troubled with this sorrow<br>
so grievously that I know not what to do."<br>
"Have summoned," said Prudence, "all thy true friends and of thy family those that are wise. Tell your case,<br>
and hearken what they say in advising, and govern yourself according to their advice." <br>
Solomon says, `Do all thy business by taking advice, and thou shalt never repent.'" <br>
Then, by the advice of his wife Prudence, this Melibeus had called up a great congregation of folk,<br>
such as surgeons, physicians, old folk and young, and some of his old enemies reconciled<br>
(as it seemed by their appearance) to his love and into his grace;<br>
and therewithal there came some of his neighbors that did him reverence<br>
more for dread than for love, as it often happens.<br>
There came also very many subtle flatterers and wise advocates learned in the law.<br>
And when this folk were assembled together, this Melibeus in sorrowful manner showed them his case.<br>
And by the manner of his speech it seemed that in heart he bore a cruel anger,<br>
ready to do vengeance upon his foes, and desired that the war should begin very soon;<br>
but nevertheless, yet he asked their advice upon this matter.<br>
A surgeon, by permission and assent of such as were wise, stood up<br>
and to Melibeus said as you can hear:<br>
"Sir," said he, "as to us surgeons it is our duty that we do to every person the best that we can,<br>
where we are employed, and to our patients that we do no damage,<br>
because of which it happens many times and often that when two men have each one wounded the other,<br>
one same surgeon heals them both;<br>
therefore unto our art it is not fitting to nourish war nor to support warring factions. <br>
But certainly, as to the curing of your daughter, although it be so that she is perilously wounded,<br>
we shall do such diligent work from day to night that with the grace of God<br>
she shall be whole and sound as soon as is possible."<br>
Almost in just the same way the physicians answered, save that they said a few words more:<br>
that just as maladies are cured by their contraries, just so shall men cure war by vengeance.<br>
His neighbors full of envy, his feigned friends that seemed reconciled, and his flatterers<br>
made an outward show of weeping, and worsened and much aggravated this matter in praising<br>
greatly Melibee of might, of power, of riches, and of friends, despising the power of his adversaries,<br>
and said flatly that he immediately should avenge himself on his foes and begin war.<br>
Up rose then an advocate that was wise,<br>
by leave and by advice of others that were wise, and said:<br>
"Gentlemen, the urgent matter for which we are assembled in this place<br>
is a very serious thing and an important matter,<br>
because of the wrong and of the wickedness that has been done,<br>
and also by reason of the great damages that in time coming<br>
are possible to befall for this same cause,<br>
and also because of the great riches and power of both the parties,<br>
for the which reasons it would be a very great peril to err in this matter.<br>
Wherefore, Melibeus, this is our opinion: we advise you above all things <br>
that right away thou do thy best efforts in keeping of thy own self in such a way<br>
that thou not lack any spy nor guard in order to save thy person.<br>
And after that, we advise that in thy house thou set sufficient garrison<br>
so that they can defend as well thy body as thy house.<br>
But certainly, to begin war, or suddenly to do vengeance, we can not decide<br>
in so little time that it would be to our advantage.<br>
Therefore we ask leisure and opportunity to have deliberation in this case to judge.<br>
For the common proverb says thus: `He that soon judges, soon shall repent.'<br>
And also men say that that judge is wise fhat soon understands a matter and judges at leisure; <br>
for although it be so that all tarrying is bothersome, <br>
it is not always to be reproved in giving of judgment nor in vengeance taking, <br>
when it is sufficient and reasonable.  <br>
And that showed our Lord Jesus Christ by example, for when the woman that was taken in adultery<br>
was brought in his presence to know what should be done with her person, although it be so that <br>
he knew well hmself what he would answer, yet he would not answer suddenly,<br>
but he would have deliberation, and in the ground he wrote twice.<br>
And by these causes we ask time for deliberation, and we shall then, by the grace of God, advise thee<br>
something that shall be beneficial."<br>
Up jumped then the young folk at once, and the most part of that company have scorned this old wise man<br>
man, and began to make noise, and said that<br>
just so as while that iron is hot men should smite,<br>
just so men should avenge their wrongs while they are fresh and new;<br>
and with loud voice they cried "War! War!"<br>
Up rose then one of these old wise men, and with his hand made signal that<br>
men should hold themselves still and give him audience.<br>
"Gentlemen," said he, "there is very many a man that cries `War, war!'<br>
who knows very little what war amounts to.<br>
War at its beginning has so big an entryway and so large that every person may enter<br>
when he pleases and easily find war;<br>
but certainly what end that shall consequently befall, it is not easy to know.<br>
For truly, when war is once begun, there is very many a child unborn of his mother<br>
that shall die young because of that same war, or else live in sorrow and die in wretchedness.<br>
And therefore, ere any war begin, men must have much advice and much deliberation."<br>
And when this old man intended to reinforce his argument by reasons, well nigh all at once they began <br>
to rise to interrupt his speech, and very often prayed him to abridge his argument.<br>
For truly, he who preaches to those who do not want to hear his words, his sermon annoys them.<br>
For Jesus son of Sirach says that "music in weeping is an annoying thing"; this is to say:<br>
it as much avails to speak before folk whom his speech annoys<br>
as it is to sing before him who weeps.<br>
And when this wise man saw that he lacked an audience, all shame-fast he set himself down again.<br>
For Solomon says: "Where thou can not have any audience, force thyself not to speak."<br>
"I see well," said this wise man, "that the common proverb is true, that<br>
`good advice is lacking when it is most needed.'"<br>
Yet had this Melibeus among his advisors many folk that secretly in his ear advised him on certain matters,<br>
and advised him the contrary in the hearing of all.<br>
When Melibeus had heard that the greatest part of his advisors were agreed that he should make war,<br>
immediately he consented to their advice and fully affirmed their opinion.<br>
Then dame Prudence, when she saw how her husband prepared himself to avenge himself on his<br>
foes and to begin war, she in very humble manner, when she saw her time, said to him these words:<br>
"My lord," said she, "I beseech you, as heartily as I dare and can,<br>
do not hasten yourself too fast and, as you hope to prosper, give me a hearing.<br>
For Petrus Alphonsus says, `Whoever does to thee either good or harm, hasten thee not to requite it,<br>
for in this manner thy friend will abide and thine enemy shall the longer live in dread.'<br>
The proverb says, `He hastens well that wisely can abide,' and `in wicked haste is no benefit.'"<br>
This Melibee answered unto his wife Prudence: "I do not intend," said he, "to work according to thy advice,<br>
for many causes and reasons. For certainly, every person would hold me then a fool;<br>
this is to say, if I, for thy advice, would change<br>
things that are ordained and affirmed by so many wise men.<br>
Secondly, I say that all women are wicked, and not one good of them all.<br>
For `of a thousand men,' says Solomon, `I found one good man, but certainly,<br>
of all women, a good woman found I never.'<br>
And also, certainly, if I governed myself according to thy advice,<br>
it should seem that I had given to thee the mastery over me,<br>
and God forbid that it were so!<br>
For Jesus son of Sirach says that `if the wife have mastery, she is contrary to her husband.'<br>
And Solomon says: `Never in thy life to thy wife, nor to thy child, nor to thy friend<br>
give any power over thyself, for it would be better that thy children<br>
ask of thy person things that they need than that thou see thyself<br>
in the hands of thy children.'<br>
And also if I would work according to thy advice, certainly, my counsel must some times be secret,<br>
until it were time that it must be known, and this may not be.<br>
When dame Prudence, very debonairly and with great patience, had heard all that her husband <br>
was pleased to say, then she asked of him permission to speak, and said in this manner:<br>
"My lord," said she, "as to your first reason, certainly it may easily be answered. For I say that<br>
it is no folly to change one's plans when the situation is changed,<br>
or else when the matter seems other than it was before.<br>
And moreover, I say that though you have sworn and promised to accomplish<br> 
performing that same undertaking for a good reason, men should not say therefore that you are a liar nor forsworn.<br>
For the book says that `the wise man tells no lie when he turns his inclination to the better.'<br>
And although it be so that your undertaking is established and decided upon by a great multitude of folk,<br>
yet you need not carry out that plan unless you want to.<br>
For the truth of things and the benefit are rather found in few folk that are wise and<br>
full of reason than by a great multitude of folk where every man cries and babbles what he pleases.<br>
Truly such a multitude is not honorable.<br>
And as to the second reason, where you say that all women are wicked;<br>
with all due respect to you, certainly you despise all women in this manner, and<br>
`he who despises all, displeases all,' as says the book.<br>
And Seneca says that `whosoever will have wisdom shall no man disparage,<br>
but he shall gladly teach the knowledge that he knows without presumption or pride;<br>
and such things of which he knows nothing, he should not be ashamed to learn them,<br>
and ask for advice from lesser folk than himself.'<br>
And, sir, that there has been many a good woman may easily be proven.<br>
For certainly, sir, our Lord Jesus Christ would never have condescended to be born of a woman,<br>
if all women had been wicked.<br>
And after that, for the great goodness that is in women,<br>
our Lord Jesus Christ, when he was risen from death to life,<br>
appeared to a woman rather than to his Apostles.<br>
And though Solomon says that he never found a good woman,<br>
it follows not therefore that all women are wicked.<br>
For though he found no good woman, certainly,<br>
many another man has found many a woman very good and true.<br>
Or else, possibly, the intent of Solomon was this:<br>
that, in supreme goodness, he found no woman --<br>
this is to say, that there is no creature who has supreme goodness save God alone,<br>
as he himself records in his Gospels.<br>
For there is no creature so good that he does not lack<br>
something of the perfection of God, who is his maker.<br>
Your third reason is this: you say that if you govern yourself by my advice,<br>
it should seem that you had given me the mastery and the lordship over your person.<br>
Sir, with all due respect to you, it is not so. For if it were true that no man should be advised<br>
but only of them that had lordship and mastery of his person, men would not be advised so often.<br>
For truly that man who asks advice about a plan, yet has free choice<br>
whether he will follow by that advice or non.<br>
And as to your fourth reason, where you say that the gossip of women can hide things that they<br>
know not, as who says that a woman can not hide what she knows;<br>
sir, these words are understood of women that are gossips and wicked;<br>
of which women men say that three things drive a man out of his house --<br>
that is to say, smoke, dropping of rain, and wicked wives;<br>
and of such women says Solomon that<br>
`it were better dwell in desert than with a woman that is dissolute.'<br>
And sir, by your leave, that am not I,<br>
for you have very often tested my great silence and my great patience, and also how well that<br>
I can hide and conceal things that men ought secretly to hide.<br>
And truly, as to your fifth reason, where you say that in wicked advice women vanquish men,<br>
God knows, that reason has no value here.<br>
For understand now, you ask advice to do wickedness;<br>
and if you will do wickedness, and your wife restrains that wicked purpose,<br>
and overcomes you by reason and by good advice,<br>
certainly your wife ought rather to be praised than blamed.<br>
Thus should you understand the philosopher that says, `In wicked advice women vanquish their husbands.'<br>
And whereas you blame all women and their reasons, I shall show you by many examples that<br>
many a woman has been very good, and yet are, and their advices very wholesome and beneficial.<br>
Also some men have said that the counsel of women<br>
is either too expensive or else too little of price.<br>
But although it be so that very many a woman is bad and her advice vile and not worthy,<br>
yet have men found very many a good woman, and very discrete and wise in giving counsel.<br>
Lo, Jacob by the good advice of his mother Rebecca won the blessing of Isaac his fader<br>
and the lordship over all his brethren.<br>
Judith by her good advice delivered the city of Bethulia, in which she dwelled,<br>
out of the hands of Holofernus, who had besieged it and would have entirely destroyed it.<br>
Abigail delivered Nabal her husband from David the king, who would have slain him,<br>
and appeased the anger of the king by her wit and by her good advice.<br>
Hester by her good counsel advanced greatly the people of God in the reign of Assuerus the king.<br>
And the same goodness in good advising of many a good woman may men tell.<br>
And moreover, when our Lord had created Adam, our forefather, he said in this manner:<br>
`It is not good to be a man alone; let us make for him a helpmate similar to himself.'<br>
Here may you see that if women were not good, and their advice good and beneficial,<br>
our Lord God of heaven would never have made them,<br>
nor called them help of man, but rather confusion of man.<br>
And there said once a clerk in two verses, `What is better than gold? Jasper.<br>
What is better than jasper? Wisdom.<br>
And what is better than wisdom? Woman. And what is better than a good woman? Nothing.'<br>
And, sir, by many other reasons may you see that<br>
many women are good, and their advice good and beneficial.<br>
And therefore, sir, if you will trust to my advice, I shall restore you your daughter whole and sound.<br>
And also I will do for you so much that you shall have honor in this undertaking."<br>
When Melibee had heard the words of his wife Prudence, he said thus:<br>
"I see well that the word of Solomon is sooth.<br>
He says that `words that are spoken discretely and properly are honeycombs,<br>
for they give sweetness to the soul and healthfulness to the body.'<br>
And, wife, because of thy sweet words, and also because I have tested and proven thy great wisdom <br>
and thy great truth, I will govern myself by thy advice in all things."<br>
"Now, sir," said dame Prudence, "and since you consent to be governed by my advice,<br>
I will inform you how you shall govern yourself in the choice of your advisors.<br>
You shall first in all your works meekly beseech the high God that he will be your advisor;<br>
and prepare yourself with the aim that he give you advice and comfort, as Tobias taught his son:<br>
`At all times thou shalt bless God, and pray him to prepare thy ways,<br>
and look that all thy counsels are in him for evermore.'<br>
Saint James also says: `If any of you have need of wisdom, ask it of God.'<br>
And afterward then shall you take advice in yourself,<br>
and examine well your thoughts of such thing as it seems to you best for your advantage. <br>
And then shall you drive from your heart three things that are contrary to good advice;<br>
that is to say, anger, greed, and haste.<br>
"First, he who asks advice of himself, certainly he must be without anger, for many reasons.<br>
The first is this: he who has great anger and wrath in himself, he supposes always that<br>
he can do a thing that he can not do.<br>
And secondly, he who is angry and wrathful, he can not well judge;<br>
and he who can not well judge, can not well advise.<br>
The third is this, that he that is angry and wrathful, as says Seneca,<br>
can not speak anything but blameworthy things,<br>
and with his vicious words he stirs other folk to anger and to ire.<br>
And also, sir, you must drive greed out of your heart.<br>
For the Apostle says that greed is root of all harms.<br>
And trust well that a greedy man can neither judge nor think anything,<br>
except only to fulfill the object of his greed;<br>
and certainly, that can never be accomplished,<br>
for always the more abundance that he has of riches, the more he desires.<br>
And, sir, you must also drive out of your heart haste; for certainly,<br>
you can not judge for the best by a sudden thought that falls in your heart,<br>
but you must reflect upon it very often.<br>
For, as you heard before this, the common proverb is this, that `he who soon judges, soon repents.'<br>
Sir, you are not always in the same frame of mind;<br>
for certainly, something that sometimes seems to you that it is good to do,<br>
another time it seems to you the contrary.<br>
"When you have pondered the matter and have judged by good deliberation such thing as seems best to you,<br>
then I advise you that you keep it secret.<br>
Reveal your plans to no person, but if it so be that you believe truly <br>
through your revealing your condition shall be to you the more advantageous.<br>
For Jesus son of Sirach says, `Neither to thy foe nor to thy friend discover not thy secret nor thy folly,<br>
for they will give you audience and attention and support in thy presence and scorn thee in thine absence.'<br>
Another clerk says that `scarcely shalt thou find any person that can keep plans secretly.'<br>
The book says, `While thou keepest thy plan in thine heart, thou keepest it in thy prison,<br>
and when thou reveal thy plans to any person, he holds thee in his snare.'<br>
And therefore for you it is better to hide your plans in your heart than pray him<br>
to whom you have revealed your plans that he will keep it close and still.<br>
For Seneca says: `If it so be that thou can not hide thine own plans,<br>
how dare thou pray any other person to keep thy advice secretly?'<br>
But nevertheless, if thou believe truly that the revealing of thy plans to a person will make<br>
thy condition stand in the better condition, then shalt thou tell him thy plans in this manner.<br>
First thou shalt make no outward sign whether thou would prefer peace or war, or this or that,<br>
nor show him not thy will and thine intent.<br>
For trust well that commonly these advisors are flatterers,<br>
namely the advisors of great lords,<br>
for they force themselves always rather to speak pleasant words, inclining to the lord's desire,<br>
than words that are true or beneficial.<br>
And therefore men say that the rich man has seldom good advice, unless he have it of himself.<br>
And after that thou shalt consider thy friends and thine enemies.<br>
And as concerning thy friends, thou shalt consider which of them are<br>
most faithful and most wise and eldest and most proven in giving advice;<br>
and of them shalt thou ask thy advice, as the case requires.<br>
I say that first you shall call to your council your friends that are true.<br>
For Solomon says that `just as the heart of a man delights in taste that is sweet,<br>
just so the advice of true friends gives sweetness to the soul.'<br>
He says also, `Nothing can be compared to a true friend,<br>
for certainly gold nor silver are not worth so much as the good will of a true friend.'<br>
And also he says that `a true friend is a strong defense; whoever finds it,<br>
certainly he finds a great treasure.'<br>
Then shall you also consider whether your true friends are discrete and wise.<br>
For the book says, `Ask always thy advice of those who are wise.'<br>
And by this same reason shall you call to your council some of your friends that are of suitably advanced age,<br>
such as have seen and are expert in many things and are proven in giving advice.<br>
For the book says that `in old men is the wisdom, and in long time the prudence. <br>
And Cicero says that `great things are not always accomplished by strength, nor by agility of body, but<br>
by good advice, by a person's power to persuade, and by knowledge; the which three things are not enfeebled by age,<br>
but certainly they gain strength and increase day by day.'<br>
And then shall you keep this for a general rule: First you shall call to your council<br>
a few of your friends who are particularly esteemed;<br>
for Solomon says, `Many friends have thou, but among a thousand chose thyself one to be thy advisor.'<br>
For although it be so that thou first tell thy advice only to a few,<br>
thou mayst afterward tell it to more folk if it be needed.<br>
But look always that thy advisors have those three conditions that I have said before --<br>
that is to say, that they are true, wise, and of old experience.<br>
And work not always in every need by one advisor alone;<br>
for sometimes it is necessary to be advised by many.<br>
For Solomon says, `Salvation of things is where there are many advisors.'<br>
"Now, since I have told you of which folk you should be advised, now<br>
I will teach you which advice you ought to shun.<br>
First, you shall shun the advice of fools; for Solomon says, `Take no counsel of a fool,<br>
for he can not advise except in accordance with his own desire and his inclination.'<br>
The book says that `the characteristic of a fool is this: he easily believes harm of every person,<br>
and easily believes all goodness in himself.'<br>
Thou shalt also shun the advice of all flatterers, such as exert themselves rather to praise your person  <br>
by flattery than to tell you the truth of things.<br>
Wherefore Cicero says, `Amongst all the pestilences that are in friendship the greatest is flattery.'<br>
And therefore is it more needful that thou shun and dread flatterers than any other people.<br>
The book says, `Thou shalt rather dread and flee from the sweet words of flattering praisers<br>
than from the sharp words of thy friend who tells thee thy truths.'<br>
Solomon says that `the words of a flatterer is a snare with which to catch innocents.'<br>
He says also that `he who speaks to his friend words of sweetness and of pleasance<br>
sets a net before his feet to catch him.'<br>
And therefore says Cicero, `Incline not thine ears to flatterers, and take no advice of the words of flattery.'<br>
And Cato says, `Ponder thee well, and shun the words of sweetness and of pleasance.'<br>
And also thou shalt shun the advice of thine old enemies that are reconciled.<br>
The book says that `no person returns safely into the good will of his old enemy.'<br>
And Aesop says, `Trust not to those with whom thou hast had at some time war or enmity, <br>
nor tell them not thy plans.'<br>
And Seneca tells the reason why: `It may not be,' says he, `that where great<br>
fire has long time endured, but that there dwells some vapor of warmness.'<br>
And therefore says Solomon, `In thine old foe trust never.'<br>
For surely, though thine enemy be reconciled, and makes thee the appearance of humility,<br>
and bows to thee with his head, trust him never.<br>
For certainly he makes that feigned humility more for his advantage than for any love of thy person,<br>
because he supposes to have victory over thy person by such feigned behavior,<br>
the which victory he might not have by strife or war.<br>
And Petrus Alphnsus says, `Make no fellowship with thine old enemies, for if thou do them goodness,<br>
they will pervert it into wickedness.'<br>
And also thou most shun the advice of those who are thy servants and bear thee great reverence,<br>
for perhaps they say it more for dread than for love.<br>
And therefore says a philosopher in this manner:<br>
`There is no person perfectly true to him whom he too sorely dreads.'<br>
And Cicero says, `There is no might so great of any emperor that long may endure,<br>
unless he has more love of the people than dread.'<br>
Thou shalt also shun the advice of folk that are drunkards, for they nor can hide no plans.<br>
For Solomon says, `There is no secrecy where drunkenness reigns.'<br>
You shall also be suspicious of the advice of such folk as<br>
advise you one thing privately and counsel you the contrary openly.<br>
For Cassiodorus says that `it is a difficult task to hinder a scheme,  <br>
when a person appears to do one thing openly and secretly works the contrary.'<br>
Thou shalt also be suspicious of the advice of wicked folk. For the book says,<br>
`The advice of wicked folk is always full of fraud.'<br>
And David says, `Blissful is that man who has not followed the advice of scoundrels.' <br>
Thou shalt also shun the advice of young folk, for their counsel is not ripe.<br>
"Now, sir, since I have showed you of which folk you shall take your advice<br>
and of which folk you shall follow the advice,<br>
now will I teach you how you shall examine your advice, according to the doctrine of Cicero.<br>
In the examining then of your advisor you shall consider many things .<br>
First of all thou shalt consider that in that thing that thou intendest, and upon which thing thou will have advice,<br>
that real truth be said and preserved; this is to say, tell truly thy tale.<br>
For he that speaks falsely may not well be advised in that case of which he lies.<br>
And after this thou shalt consider the things that agree with that thou intendest<br>
for to act as thy advisors advise, if reason accord thereto,<br>
and also if thy might can attain thereto, and if the larger part<br>
and the better part of thy advisors accord thereto, or not.<br>
Then shalt thou consider what thing shall follow from that advice,<br>
as hate, peace, war, grace, profit, or damage, and many other things.<br>
And in all these things thou shalt chose the best and abandon all other things .<br>
Then shalt thou consider of what root is engendered the matter of thy advice<br>
and what fruit it may conceive and engender.<br>
Thou shalt also consider all these causes, from whence they are sprung.<br>
And when you have examined your advice, as I have said, and (decided) which part is the better<br>
and more beneficial, and have tested it by many wise and old folk,<br>
then shalt thou consider if thou can perform it and make of it a good end.<br>
For certainly reason will not desire that any man should begin a thing<br>
unless he might perform it as he ought to;<br>
nor no person should take upon him so heavy a charge that he might not bear it.<br>
For the proverb says, `He who too much embraces, keeps little.'<br>
And Cato says, `Try to do such thing as thou hast power to do,<br>
lest that the charge oppress thee so sorely that<br>
thou art compelled to abandon an undertaking that thou hast begun.'<br>
And if it so be that thou art in doubt about whether thou can perform a thing or not,<br>
choose rather to suffer than begin.<br>
And Petrus Alphonsus says, `If thou hast might to do a thing of which thou must repent,<br>
it is better "nay" than "yea."'<br>
This is to say, that for thee it is better hold thy tongue still than to speak.<br>
Then may you understand by stronger reasons that if thou hast power to perform a work<br>
of which thou shalt repent, then is it better that thou suffer than begin.<br>
Well say they who forbid every person to attempt a thing of which he is in doubt<br>
whether he can perform it or not.<br>
And after, when you have examined your advice, as I have said before, and know well that<br>
you can perform your enterprise, prosecute it then diligently until it be at an end.<br>
"Now is it reasonable and time that I show you when and wherefore that<br>
you may change your plans without earning dishonor.<br>
Truly, a man may change his purpose and his plans if the cause ceases,<br>
or when a new case befalls.<br>
For the law says that `things that newly befall require new plans.' <br>
And Seneca says, `If thy plan is come to the ears of thine enemy, change thy plan.'<br>
Thou mayst also change thy plan if it so be that thou find that by error,<br>
or by other cause, harm or damage may befall.<br>
Also if thy plan be unjust, or else comes of dishonest cause, change thy plan.<br>
For the laws say that `all promises that are dishonest are of no value';<br>
and also if it so be that it is impossible, or can not goodly be performed or kept.<br>
"And take this for a general rule, that every plan that is affirmed so strongly that it may not<br>
be changed for any condition that may befall, I say that that plan is wicked."<br>
This Melibeus, when he had heard the doctrine of his wife dame Prudence, answered in this wise:<br>
"Dame," said he, "as yet until this time you have well and fittingly taught me as in general how<br>
I should govern myself in the choice and in the retention of my advisors.<br>
But now would I eagerly desire that you would get down to particulars <br>
and tell me how you like it, or what it seems to you, concerning our advisors<br>
that we have chosen in our present need."<br>
"My lord," said she, "I beseech you in all humility that you will not willfully reply against my arguments,<br>
nor upset your heart, though I speak something that may displease you.<br>
For God knows that, in my intent, I speak it for your best,<br>
for your honor, and for your benefit also.<br>
And truly, I hope that your benignity will take it in patience.<br>
Trust me well," said she, "that your advice in this case should not, to speak properly,<br>
be called an advising, but a motion or a moving of folly,<br>
in which advice you have erred in many a different way.<br>
"First of all, you have erred in the assembling of your advisors.<br>
For you should first have called a few folk to your council, and after you might have showed it<br>
to more folk, if it had been necessary.<br>
But certainly, you have suddenly called to your council a great multitude of people,<br>
very burdensome and very annoying to hear.<br>
Also you have erred, for whereas you should only have called to your council <br>
your true friends old and wise,<br>
you have called foreign folk, young folk, false flatterers, and enemies reconciled,<br>
and folk who do you reverence without love.<br>
And also you have erred, for you have brought with you to your council anger, greed, and haste,<br>
the which three things are contrary to every council honorable and beneficial;<br>
the which three things you have not annihilated or destroyed them,<br>
neither in yourself, nor in your advisors, as you ought.<br>
You have erred also, for you have shown to your advisors<br>
your desire and your inclination to make war immediately and to do vengeance.<br>
They have espied by your words to what thing you are inclined;<br>
and therefore have they advised you rather to your inclination than to your advantage.<br>
You have erred also, for it seems that to you it suffices<br>
to have been advised by these counselors only, and with little consultation,<br>
whereas in so great and so urgent a situation it had been necessary to have more advisors<br>
and more deliberation to perform your undertaking.<br>
You have erred also, for you have not examined your advice in the foresaid manner,<br>
nor in suitable manner, as the case requires.<br>
You have erred also, for you have made no division between your advisors -- this is to say,<br>
between your true friends and your feigned advisors --<br>
and you have not known the will of your true friends old and wise,<br>
but you have cast all their words in an hodgepodge, and inclined your heart to the larger part<br>
and to the greater number, and to that you are yielded.<br>
And since you know well that men shall always find a greater number of fools than of wise men,<br>
and therefore the counsels that are at gatherings and multitudes of folk, where men pay more attention<br>
to the number than to the wisdom of persons,<br>
you see well that in such councils fools have the mastery."<br>
Melibeus answered again, and said, "I grant well that I have erred;<br>
but whereas thou hast told me before now<br>
that he is not to blame who changes his advisors in certain cases and for certain just causes,<br>
I am all ready to change my advisors just as thou will devise.<br>
The proverb says that `to do sin is human,<br>
but certainly to persevere long in sin is work of the devil.'"<br>
To this sentence answered immediately dame Prudence, and said,<br>
"Examine," said she, "your counsel, and let us see<br>
the which of them have spoken most reasonably and taught you best advice.<br>
And forasmuch as the examination is necessary, let us begin at the surgeons<br>
and at the physicians, who first spoke in this matter.<br>
I tell you that the surgeons and physicians have spoken to you in counselling you discretely, as they ought,<br>
and in their speech said very wisely that to their office it pertains to do to every person<br>
honor and profit, and no person to harm,<br>
and in accordance with their craft to do great diligence<br>
unto the care of those that they have in their governance.<br>
And, sir, just as they have answered wisely and discretely,<br>
just so I deduce that they are highly and chiefly rewarded for their noble speech,<br>
and also for they should do the more diligent effort in the care of your dear daughter.<br>
For although it be so that they are your friends, therefore shall you not allow <br>
that they serve you for naught,<br>
but you ought the rather to reward them and show them your generosity.<br>
And as touching the theory that the physicians developed in this case -- this is to say,<br>
that in maladies that one contrary is cured by another contrary --<br>
I would be eager to know how you understand that text, and what is your interpretation."<br>
"Certainly," said Melibeus, "I understand it in this way:<br>
that just as they have done me a contrary, right so should I do them another.<br>
For just as they have avenged themselves on me and done me wrong,<br>
just so shall I avenge myself upon them and do them wrong;<br>
and then have I cured one contrary by another."<br>
"Lo, lo," said dame Prudence, "how easily is every man inclined to his own desire<br>
and to his own pleasure!<br>
Certainly," said she, "the words of the physicians should not have been understood in this way.<br>
For certainly, wickedness is not contrary to wickedness, nor vengeance to vengeance,<br>
nor wrong to wrong, but they are similar.<br>
And therefore one vengeance is not cured by another vengeance, nor one wrong by another wrong,<br>
but each of them increases and aggravates the other.<br>
But certainly, the words of the physicians should be understood in this way:<br>
for good and wickedness are two contraries, and peace and war, vengeance<br>
and forbearance, discord and accord, and many other things ;<br>
but certainly, wickedness must be cured by goodness, discord by accord, war by peace,<br>
and so forth of other things .<br>
And to this Saint Paul the Apostle agrees in many places.<br>
He says, `Yield not harm for harm, nor wicked speech for wicked speech,<br>
but do well to him that does thee harm and bless him that says to thee harm.'<br>
And in many other places he recommends peace and accord.<br>
But now will I speak to you of the advice which was given to you<br>
by the men of law and the wise folk,<br>
who said all by unanimous agreement, as you have heard before,<br>
that over all things you shall do your best effort to guard your person and to garrison your house;<br>
and said also that in this case you ought to work very advisedly and with great deliberation.<br>
And, sir, as to the first point, that touches on the keeping of your person,<br>
you shall understand that he who has war shall evermore meekly and devoutly pray, before all things,<br>
that Jesus Christ of his mercy will have him in his protection<br>
and be his best help at his need.<br>
For certainly, in this world there is no person that can be advised nor guarded sufficiently<br>
without the protection of our Lord Jesus Christ.<br>
To this opinion agrees the prophet David, who says,<br>
`If God does not guard the city, in vain watches he who guards it.'<br>
Now, sir, then shall you commit the guarding of your person<br>
to your true friends that are proven and known,<br>
and of them shall you ask help to guard your person. For Cato says,<br>
`If thou hast need of help, ask it of thy friends,<br>
for there is no physician so good as thy true friend.'<br>
And after this then shall you keep yourself from all unfamiliar folk, and from liars,<br>
and be always suspicious of their company.<br>
For Petrus Alphonsus says, `take no company by the way of a strange man,<br>
but if it so be that thou have known him of a longer time.<br>
And if it so be that he fall into thy company by chance, without thine assent,<br>
inquire then as subtly as thou can of his way of life, and of his life before, and feign thy way;<br>
say that [thou] wolt thither as thou will not go;<br>
and if he bears a spear, hold thyself on the right side,<br>
and if he bear a sword, hold thyself on the left side.'<br>
And after this then shall you keep yourself wisely from all such manner people as I have said before,<br>
and them and their advice shun.<br>
And after this then shall you keep yourself in such manner<br>
that, for any confidence in your strength, that you nor despise not, nor account not the might<br>
of your adversary so little that you neglect the protection of your person because of your over-confidence,<br>
for every wise man dreads his enemy.<br>
And Solomon says, `Happy is he who of all has dread,<br>
for certainly, he who through the hardiness of his heart and through the hardiness of himself has<br>
too great self-confidence, to him shall evil befall.'<br>
Then shall you evermore watch out for ambushes and all espionage,<br>
For Seneca says that `the wise man who dreads harms, shuns harms,<br>
nor does he who shuns perils fall into perils.'<br>
And although it be so that it seems that thou art in a safe place,<br>
yet shalt thou always do thy best efforts in guarding of thy person;<br>
this is to say, be not negligent to guard thy person<br>
not only from thy greatest enemies but from thy least enemy.<br>
Seneca says, `A man that is well advised, he dreads his least enemy.'<br>
Ovid says that `the little weasel will slay the great bull and the wild hart.'<br>
And the book says, `A little thorn may prick a king very sorely,<br>
and a hound will bring to bay the wild boar.'<br>
But nevertheless, I say not thou should be so cowardly that thou fear where there is no reason for dread.<br>
The book says that `some folk have great desire to deceive, but yet they dread themselves to be deceived.'<br>
Yet thou should dread to be poisoned and keep thyself from the company of scoffers.<br>
For the book says, `With scorners make no company, but flee their words as venom.'<br>
"Now, as to the second point,<br>
whereas your wise advisors counseled you to fortify your house with great diligence,<br>
I would be eager to know how you understand those words and what is your decision."<br>
Melibeus answered and said, "Certainly, I understand it in this way: That I should fortify my house with towers,<br>
such as have castles and other sorts of edifices, and armor, and artillery,<br>
by which things I can my person and my house so guard and defend<br>
that my enemies shall be in dread to approach my house."<br>
To this sentence answered immediately Prudence: "Fortifying," said she,<br>
"of high towers and of great edifices pertains sometimes to pride.<br>
And also men make high towers, [and great edifices] with great expenditures and with great travail,<br>
and when that they are accomplished, yet are they not worth a straw,<br>
unless they are defended by true friends that are old and wise.<br>
And understand well that the greatest and strongest garrison that a rich man may have,<br>
as well to keep his person as his goods, is<br>
that he is beloved by his subjects and by his neighbors.<br>
For thus says Cicero, that `there is a sort of garrison <br>
that no man can vanquish nor discomfit, and that is<br>
for a lord to be beloved by his citizens and by his people.'<br>
Now, sir, as to the third point, whereas your old<br>
and wise advisors said that you ought not suddenly nor hastily proceed in this urgent matter,<br>
but that you ought to prepare yourself and get ready in this case with great diligence and great deliberation;<br>
truly, I believe that they spoke very wisely and real truth.<br>
For Cicero says, `In every urgent matter, ere thou begin it, prepare thyself with great diligence.'<br>
Then say I that in vengeance-taking, in war, in battle, and in fortification,<br>
ere thou begin, I advise that thou prepare thyself for that, and do it with great deliberation.<br>
For Cicero says that `long preparation before the battle makes short victory.'<br>
And Cassiodorus says, `The protection is stronger when it is long time considered.'<br>
But now let us speak of the advice that was agreed upon by your neighbors,<br>
such as do you reverence without love,<br>
your old enemies reconciled, your flatterers,<br>
that advised you certain things secretly, and openly counseled you the contrary;<br>
the young folk also, who advised you to avenge yourself and make war immediately.<br>
And certainly, sir, as I have said before, you have greatly erred<br>
to have called such sort of folk to your council,<br>
which advisors are enough reproved by the reasons spoken earlier.<br>
But nevertheless, let us now descend to the particular details. You should first proceed according to the doctrine of Cicero.<br>
Certainly, the truth of this matter, or of this advice, we need not diligently inquire,<br>
for it is well known who they are that have done to you this trespass and villainy,<br>
and how many trespassers, and in what manner<br>
they have done to you all this wrong and all this villainy.<br>
And after this, then you should examine the second condition which the same Cicero adds in this matter.<br>
For Cicero hypothesized a thing which he calls `consenting'; this is to say,<br>
who are they, and which are they and how many that consent to thy advice<br>
in thy willfulness to do hasty vengeance.<br>
And let us consider also who are they, and how many are they,   <br>
and which are they that consented to your adversaries.<br>
And certainly, as to the first point, it is well known which folk are<br>
they that consented to your hasty willfulness,<br>
for truly, all those who advised you to make sudden war are not your friends.<br>
Let us now consider which are they that you consider so greatly your friends as to your person.<br>
For although it be so that you are mighty and rich, certainly you are but alone,<br>
for certainly you have no child but a daughter,<br>
nor do you have neither brethren, nor first cousins, nor any other close relatives,<br>
for which your enemies for dread should stop pleading with you or destroying your person.<br>
You know also that your riches must be dispended in several parts,<br>
and when each person has his part, they will take but little regard to avenging thy death.<br>
But thine enemies are three, and they have many children, brethren, cousins, and other close kin.<br>
And though it so were that thou haddest slain of them two or three, yet dwell there enough<br>
to avenge their death and to slay thy person.<br>
And though it so be that your kin are more sure and steadfast than the kin of your adversary,<br>
yet nevertheless your kinship is but a far kinship; they are but little related to you,<br>
and the kin of your enemies are close relatives to them.<br>
And certainly, in that respect, their condition is better than yours.<br>
Then let us consider also the advice of those who advised you to take sudden vengeance,<br>
whether it accord to reason.<br>
And certainly, you know well `nay.'<br>
For, by justice and reason, there may no man take vengeance on no person<br>
but the judge that has the jurisdiction of it,<br>
when it is granted to him to take that vengeance hastily or temperately, as the law requires.<br>
And yet moreover of that word that Cicero calls `consenting,'<br>
thou should consider if thy might and thy power can consent<br>
and suffice to thy willfulness and to thy advisors.<br>
And certainly thou can well say that `nay.'<br>
For truly, strictly speaking, we can do no thing<br>
but only such thing as we can do justly.<br>
And certainly in justice must you take no vengeance, as of your own authority.<br>
Then must you see that your power is not consistent, nor accords not, with your willfulness.<br>
"Let us now examine the third point, that Cicero calls `consequent.'<br>
Thou shalt understand that the vengeance that thou intendest to take is the consequent;<br>
and thereof follows another vengeance, peril, and war, and other damages without number,<br>
of which we are not aware, at this time.<br>
And as touching the fourth point, what Cicero calls `engendering,'<br>
thou shalt consider that this wrong which that is done to thee<br>
is engendered by the hate of thine enemies,<br>
and by the vengeance-taking thereupon that would engender another vengeance,<br>
and much sorrow and wasting of riches, as I said.<br>
"Now, sir, as to the point that Cicero calls `causes,' which is the last point,<br>
thou shalt understand that the wrong that thou hast received has certain causes,<br>
which clerks call Oriens and Efficiens, and Causa longinqua and Causa propinqua;<br>
this is to say, the far cause and the near cause.<br>
The far cause is almighty God, that is cause of all things .<br>
The near cause is thy three enemies.<br>
The cause accidental was hate.<br>
The cause material are the five wounds of thy daughter.<br>
The cause formal is the manner of their working who brought ladders and climbed in at thy windows.<br>
The cause final was to slay thy daughter. It did not delay insofar as was in their power.<br>
But to speak of the far cause, as to what end they shall come, or what shall finally<br>
happen to them in this case, nor can I judge except by conjecture and by supposing.<br>
For we should suppose that they shall come to a wicked end,<br>
because the Book of Decrees says, `Seldom, or with great effort, are causes brought to a good end<br>
when they are badly begun.'<br>
"Now, sir, if men would ask me why God allowed men to do you this villainy,<br>
certainly, I can not well answer, with any certainty.<br>
For the apostle says that `the sciences and the judgments of our Lord God almighty are very deep;<br>
there can no man comprehend nor study them sufficiently.'<br>
Nonetheless, by certain assumptions and conjectures, I hold and believe<br>
that God, who is full of justice and of righteousness, has allowed this to happen by just reasonable cause.<br>
"Thy name is Melibee; this is to say, `a man that drinks honey.'<br>
Thou hast drunk so much honey of sweet temporal riches, and pleasures and honors of this world<br>
that thou art drunk and hast forgotten Jesus Christ thy creator.<br>
Thou hast not done to him such honor and reverence as thee ought,<br>
nor thou hast not well paid attention to the words of Ovid, who says,<br>
`Under the honey of the goods of the body is hid the venom that slays the soul.'<br>
And Solomon says, `If thou hast found honey, eat of it what suffices,<br>
for if thou eat of it to excess, thou shalt vomit' and be needy and poor.<br>
And perhaps Christ has thee in disdain, and<br>
has turned away from thee his face and his ears of mercy,<br>
and also he has allowed that thou hast been punished in the manner that thou hast trespassed.<br>
Thou hast done sin again our Lord Christ,<br>
for certainly, the three enemies of mankind<br>
-- that is to say, the flesh, the fiend, and the world --<br>
thou hast allowed them enter into thine heart willfully by the windows of thy body,<br>
and hast not defended thyself sufficiently against their assaults and their temptations,<br>
so that they have wounded thy soul in five places;<br>
this is to say, the deadly sins that are entered into thine heart by thy five senses.<br>
And in the same manner our Lord Christ has willed and allowed <br>
that thy three enemies are entered into thine house by the windows<br>
and have wounded thy daughter in the aforesaid manner."<br>
"Certainly," said Melibee, "I see well that you strengthen yourself much by words to overcome me in such a manner<br>
that I shall not avenge me on my enemies,<br>
showing me the perils and the evils that might fall because of this vengeance.<br>
But if amyone would consider in all vengeances the perils and evils that might follow from vengeance-taking,<br>
a man would never take vengeance, and that would be a harm;<br>
for by the vengeance-taking are the wicked men distinguished from the good men,<br>
and they that have will to do wickedness restrain their wicked purpose,<br>
when they see the punishing and chastising of the trespassers."<br>
And yet say I more, that just as a private person sins in taking vengeance on another man,<br>
just so sins the judge if he do no vengeance on them that have deserved it.<br>
For Seneca says thus: `That master,' he says, `is good who reproves scoundrels.'<br>
And as Cassiodorus says, `A man dreads to do outrages when he knows and is aware<br>
that it displeases the judges and the rulers.'<br>
And another says, `The judge that dreads to do justice makes men scoundrels.'<br>
And Saint Paul the Apostle says in his Epistle, when he writes unto the Romans, that<br>
`the judges do not bear the spear without cause,<br>
but they bear it to punish the scoundrels and evildoers and to defend the good men.'<br>
If you will then take vengeance on your enemies, you shall turn to or bring your case to the judge<br>
that has the jurisdiction upon them,<br>
and he shall punish them as the law asks and requires."<br>
"A," said Melibee, "this vengeance pleases me not at all.<br>
I consider now and take heed how Fortune has nourished me from my childhood<br>
and has helped me to pass many a difficult situation.<br>
Now will I test her, believing that, with God's help, she shall help me to avenge my shame."<br>
"Certainly," said Prudence, "if you will work by my advice, you shall not test Fortune in any way,<br>
nor shall you rely on or bow unto her, according to the word of Seneca,<br>
for `things that are foolishly done, and that are in hope of Fortune, shall never come to a good end.'<br>
And, as the same Seneca says, `The more clear and the more shining that Fortune is,<br>
the more brittle and the sooner broken she is.'<br>
Trust not in her, for she is not steadfast nor stable,<br>
for when thou believest her to be most sure or certain of her help,<br>
she will fail thee and deceive thee.<br>
And whereas you say that Fortune has nourished you from your childhood,<br>
I say that to that degree should you have the less trust in her and in her wisdom.<br>
For Seneca says, `Whatever man that is nourished by Fortune, she makes him a great fool.'<br>
Now then, since you desire and ask vengeance, and the vengeance that is done according to the law<br>
and before the judge pleases you not,<br>
and the vengeance that is done in hope of Fortune is perilous and uncertain,<br>
then have you no other remedy but to have your recourse<br>
unto the Supreme Judge that avenges all villainies and wrongs.<br>
And he shall avenge you according to what he himself witnesses, where he says,<br>
`Leave the vengeance to me, and I shall do it.'"<br>
Melibee answered, "If I do not avenge myself for the villainy that men have done to me,<br>
I summon or announce to them that have done to me that villainy,<br>
and all others, to do me another villainy.<br>
For it is written, `If thou take no vengeance of an old villainy,<br>
thou summonest thine adversaries to do thee a new villainy.'<br>
And also for my patience men would do to me so much villainy that<br>
I might neither bear nor sustain it,<br>
and so should I be put down and considered too humble.<br>
For men say, `In much suffering shall many things happen to thee which thou shalt not be able to endure.'"<br>
"Certainly," said Prudence, "I grant you that over-much patience is not good.<br>
But yet it follows not thereof that every person to whom men do villainy should take vengeance for it,<br>
for that pertains and belongs entirely only to the judges, for they shall avenge the villainies and injuries.<br>
And therefore those two authorities that you have spoken of above are only understood in the judges,<br>
for when they allow over-much the wrongs and the villainies to be done without punishing,<br>
they summon a man not entirely only to do new wrongs, but they command it. <br>
Also a wise man says that `the judge who corrects not the sinner commands and bids him to do sin.'<br>
And the judges and rulers might in their land so much tolerate the scoundrels and evildoers<br>
that they should, because of such tolerance, by the passage of time grow in such power and might<br>
that they should put out the judges and the rulers from their places,<br>
and at the last make them lose their lordships.<br>
"But let us now suppose that you have leave to avenge yourself.<br>
I say you are not of might and power right now to avenge yourself,<br>
for if you will make comparison unto the might of your adversaries, you shall find in many things that<br>
I have showed you ere this that their condition is better than yours.<br>
And therefore say I that it is good for now that you suffer and be patient.<br>
"Furthermore, you know well that according to the common saying, `it is a madness for a man to strive<br>
with a stronger or a more mighty man than he is himself,<br>
and to strive with a man of even strength -- that is to say,<br>
with as strong a man as he is -- it is perilous/85
and to strive with a weaker man, it is folly.'<br>
And therefore a man should flee striving as much as he might.<br>
For Solomon says, `It is a great honor to a man to keep himself from quarrels and strife.'<br>
And if it so befall or happen that a man of greater might and strength<br>
than thou art do thee grievance,<br>
take pains and busy thyself rather to still the same grievance than to avenge thyself.<br>
For Seneca says that `he puts himself in great peril<br>
that strives with a greater man than he is himself.'<br>
And Cato says, `If a man of higher estate or degree, or more mighty than thou,<br>
do thee annoyance or grievance, endure it,<br>
for he that once has grieved thee, may another time relieve thee and help.'<br>
Yet I assume (for the sake of argument) you have both might and permission to avenge yourself,<br>
I say that there are very many things that should restrain you from vengeance-taking<br>
and make you to incline to suffer, and to have patience<br>
in the wrongs that have been done to you.<br>
First of all, if you will consider the faults that are in your own person,<br>
for which faults God has allowed you to have this tribulation, as I have said to you before.<br>
For the poet says that `we ought patiently to take the tribulations<br>
that come to us, when we think and consider that we have deserved to have them.'<br>
And Saint Gregory says that `when a man considers well the number of his faults and of his sins,<br>
the pains and the tribulations that he suffers seem the less unto him;<br>
and inasmuch as he thinks his sins more heavy and grievous,<br>
insomuch seems his pain the lighter and the easier unto him.'<br>
Also you ought to incline and bow your heart<br>
to adopt the patience of our Lord Jesus Christ, as says Saint Peter in his Epistles.<br>
`Jesus Christ,' he says, `has suffered for us and given example to every man to follow and be guided by him,<br>
for he did never sin, nor never came there a villainous word out of his mouth.<br>
When men cursed him, he cursed them not, and when men beat him, he menaced them not.'<br>
Also the great patience which the saints that are in Paradise have had in tribulations<br>
that they have suffered, without their deserts or guilt,<br>
ought much stir you to patience.<br>
Furthermore you should force yourself to have patience,<br>
considering that the tribulations of this world but little while endure and soon are passed and gone,<br>
and the joy that a man seeks to have by patience in tribulations is ever-lasting,<br>
according to what the Apostle says in his epistle.<br>
`The joy of God,' he says, `is perdurable' -- that is to say, everlasting. <br>
Also think and believe steadfastly that he is not well trained, nor well taught,<br>
who can not have patience or will not receive patience.<br>
For Solomon says that `the doctrine and the wit of a man is known by patience.'<br>
And in another place he says that `he that is patient governs himself with great prudence.'<br>
And the same Solomon says, `The angry and wrathful man makes quarrels,<br>
and the patient man moderates and stills them.'<br>
He says also, `It is more worthy to be patient than to be very strong;<br>
and he that may have the lordship of his own heart is more to be praised than he that<br>
by his force or strength takes great cities.'<br>
And therefore says Saint James in his Epistle that `patience is a great virtue of perfection.'"<br>
"Certainly," said Melibee, "I grant you, dame Prudence, that patience is a great virtue of perfection;<br>
but every man may not have the perfection that you seek;<br>
nor am I of the number of very perfect men,<br>
for my heart may never be in peace until the time it is avenged.<br>
And although it be so that it was great peril to my enemies<br>
to do me a villainy in taking vengeance upon me,<br>
yet took they no heed of the peril, but fulfilled their wicked will and their desire.<br>
And therefore it seems to me men ought not reprove me,<br>
though I put myself in a little peril in order to avenge myself,<br>
and though I do a great excess; that is to say, that I avenge one outrage by another."<br>
"A," said dame Prudence, "you say your will and as you please,<br>
but in no case of the world should a man do outrage nor excess to avenge himself.<br>
For Cassiodorus says that `as evil does he that avenges himself by outrage as he that does the outrage.'<br>
And therefore you shall avenge yourself after the order of justice; that is to say, by the law<br>
and not by excess nor by outrage.<br>
And also, if you will avenge yourself of the outrage of your adversaries<br>
in other manner than justice commands, you sin.<br>
And therefore says Seneca that `a man shall never avenge wickedness by wickedness." <br>
And if you say that justice asks a man to fight off violence by violence and fighting by fighting,<br>
certainly you say truth, when the defense is done immediately without interval or without tarrying or delay,<br>
to defend himself and not to avenge himself.<br>
And it is fitting that a man put so much temperance in his defense<br>
that men have no cause nor matter to reprove him that defends himself from excess and outrage,<br> 
for otherwise it would be against reason.<br>
By God, you know well that you make no defense<br>
right now to defend yourself, but to avenge yourself;<br>
and so it follows that you have no will to do your deed temperately.<br>
And therefore it seems to me that patience is good. For Solomon says that<br>
`he that is not patient shall have great harm.'"<br>
"Certainly," said Melibee, "I grant you that when a man is impatient and angry with that<br>
which touches him not and which pertains not unto him, though it harm him, it is no wonder.  <br>
For the law says that `he is guilty that intrudes himself <br>
or meddles with such thing as pertains not unto him.'<br>
And Solomon says that `he that meddles with the quarrels or strife of another man<br>
is like to him that takes an hound by the ears.'<br>
For just as he that takes a strange hound by the ears is at another time bitten by the hound,<br>
in just the same way it is reasonable that he have harm who by his impatience meddles himself<br>
with the quarrels of another man, whereas it pertains not unto him.<br>
But you know well that this deed -- that is to say,<br>
my grief and my suffering -- touches me very closely.<br>
And therefore, though I am angry and impatient, it is no marvel.<br>
And, with all due respect to you, I can not see that it might greatly harm me though I took vengeance.<br>
For I am richer and more mighty than my enemies are;<br>
and you well know that by money and by having great possessions<br>
are all the things of this world governed.<br>
And Solomon says that `all things obey to money.'"<br>
When Prudence had heard her husband boast of his riches<br>
and of his money, belittling the power of his adversaries,<br>
she spoke and said in this manner:<br>
"Certainly, dear sir, I grant you that you are rich and mighty<br>
and that riches are good to those that have well gotten them and well know how to use them.<br>
For just as the body of a man can not live without the soul,<br>
no more than it can live without temporal goods.<br>
And by riches a man get can himself great friends.<br>
And therefore says Pamphilles: `If a cowherd's daughter,' says he, `is rich,<br>
she may choose of a thousand men which she will take to her husband,<br>
for, of a thousand men, not one will forsake her nor refuse her.'<br>
And this Pamphilles says also, `If thou be very happy -- that is to say,<br>
if thou be very rich -- thou shalt find a great number of fellows and friends.<br>
And if thy fortune change that thou wax poor, farewell friendship and fellowship,<br>
for thou shalt be alone without any company, except if it be the company of poor folk.'<br>
And yet says this Pamphilles moreover that `they that are enslaved and in bondage by birth<br>
shall be made worthy and noble by riches.'<br>
And just as by riches there come many goods,<br>
just so by poverty come there many harms and evils,<br>
for great poverty constrains a man to do many evils.<br>
And therefore Cassiodorus calls poverty the mother of ruin;<br>
that is to say, the mother of overthrowing or falling down.<br>
And therefore says Petrus Alphonsus, `One of the greatest adversities of this world is<br>
when a man free by nature or by birth is constrained by poverty<br>
to eat the alms of his enemy,'<br>
and the same says Innocent in one of his books. He says that<br>
`sorrowful and unfortunate is the condition of a poor beggar;<br>
for if he does not beg for his food, he dies for hunger;<br> 
and if be begs, he dies for shame, and yet necessity constrains him to beg.'<br>
And says Solomon that `better it is to die than to have such poverty.'<br>
And as the same Solomon says, `Better it is to die of bitter death<br>
than to live in such a way.'<br>
By these reasons that I have said unto you and by many other reasons that I could say,<br>
I grant you that riches are good to them that get them well<br>
and to them that well use those riches.<br>
And therefore will I show you how you should behave, and how you should bear yourself<br>
in gathering of riches, and in what manner you shall use them.<br>
"First, you shall get them without great desire, by good deliberation, slowly and not over-hastily.<br>
For a man that is too desiring to get riches devotes himself<br>
first to theft, and to all other evils;<br>
and therefore says Solomon, `He that hastens him too busily to wax rich shall be no innocent.'<br>
He says also that `the riches that hastily come to a man soon<br>
and easily go and pass from a man,<br>
but those riches that come little by little always grow and multiply.'<br>
And, sir, you shall get riches by your wit and by your travail unto your advantage,<br>
and that without doing wrong or harm to any other person.<br>
For the law says that `there makes no man himself rich, if he does harm to another person.'<br>
This is to say, that nature prohibits and forbids justly that<br>
any man make himself rich unto the harm of another person.<br>
And Cicero says that `no sorrow, nor no dread of death, nor no thing<br>
that may happen to a man, is so much against<br>
nature as for a man to increase his own advantage to the harm of another man.<br>
And though the great men and the mighty men get riches more easily than thou,<br>
yet thou shalt not be idle nor slow to do thy benefit, for thou shalt in all ways flee idleness.'<br>
For Solomon says that `idleness teaches a man to do many evils.'<br>
And the same Solomon says that `he that works and busies himself to till his land shall eat bread,<br>
but he that is idle and devotes himself to no business<br>
nor occupation shall fall into poverty and die for hunger.'<br>
And he that is idle and slow can never find suitable time to earn his profit.<br>
For there is a versifier says that `the idle man excuses himself in winter because<br>
of the great cold, and in summer by reason of the great heat.'<br>
For these causes says Cato, `Wake and incline you not over-much to sleep,<br>
for over-much rest nourishes and causes many vices.'<br>
And therefore says Saint Jerome, `Do some good deeds that the devil,<br>
which is our enemy, not find you unoccupied.'<br>
For the devil takes not easily unto his power such as he finds occupied in good works.<br>
"Then thus in getting riches you must flee idleness.<br>
And afterward, you must use the riches which you have gotten by your wit and by your labor<br>
in such a manner that men consider you not too niggardly, nor too frugal, nor too foolishly generous<br>
-- that is to say, over-generous a spender.<br>
For just as men blame an avaricious man because of his niggardliness and miserliness,<br>
in the same way is he to blame that spends over-generously.<br>
And therefore says Cato: `Use,' he says, `thy riches that thou hast gotten<br>
in such a manner that men have no reason nor cause to call thee neither wretch nor miser,<br>
for it is a great shame to a man to have a poor heart and a rich purse.'<br>
He says also, `The goods that thou hast gotten, use them by measure;'<br>
that is to say, spend them moderately,<br>
for they who foolishly waste and squander the goods that they have,<br>
when they have no more property of their own, they devote themselves to taking the goods of another man.<br>
I say then that you must flee avarice,<br>
using your riches in such a manner that men say not that your riches are buried<br>
but that you have them in your power and in your control.<br>
For a wise man reproves the avaricious man, and says thus in two verses:<br>
`For what reason and why buries a man his goods by his great avarice,<br>
and he knows well that by necessity he must die?<br>
For death is the end of every man in this present life.'<br>
And for what cause or reason he joins himself or he knits himself so fast unto his goods<br>
that all his wits can not separate him or depart him from his goods,<br>
and knows well, or ought know, that when he is dead<br>
he shall nothing bear with him out of this world?<br>
And therefore says Saint Austin that `the avaricious man is likened unto hell,<br>
that the more it swallows the more desire it has to swallow and devour.'<br>
And as well as you would shun to be called an avaricious man or miser,<br>
as well should you keep yourself and govern yourself in such a way that men do not call you foolishly generous.<br>
Therefore says Cicero: `The goods,' he says, `of thine house should not be hidden nor kept so close,<br>
but that they might not be opened by pity and graciousness'<br>
(that is to say, to give part to them that have great need),<br>
`Nor thy goods must not be so open to be every man's goods.'<br>
Afterward, in getting of your riches and in using them you must always have three things in your heart<br>
(that is to say, our Lord God, conscience, and good name).<br>
First, you shall have God in your heart,<br>
and for no riches you shall do any thing which may in any manner displease God,<br>
that is your creator and maker.<br>
For after the word of Solomon, `It is better to have a little good with the love of God<br>
than to have much good and treasure and lose the love of his Lord God.'<br>
And the prophet says that `better it is to be a good man and have little good and treasure<br>
than to be held a scoundrel and have great riches.'<br>
And yet say I furthermore, that you should always do your business to get yourself riches,<br>
providing that you get them with good conscience.<br>
And the Apostle says that `there is nothing in this world of which<br>
we should have so great joy as when our conscience bears us good witness.'<br>
And the wise man says, `The substance of a man is very good,<br>
when sin is not in man's conscience.'<br>
Afterward, in getting of your riches and in using of them,<br>
you must have great effort and greet diligence that your good name be always kept and conserved.<br>
For Solomon says that `better it is and more it avails a man to have a good name<br>
than to have great riches.'<br>
And therefore he says in another place, `Do great diligence,' says Solomon,<br>
`in keeping of thy friend and of thy good name;<br>
for it shall longer abide with thee than any treasure, be it never so precious.'<br>
And certainly he should not be called a gentle man who after God and good conscience, all other things left aside,<br>
does his best efforts and effort to keep his good name.<br>
And Cassiodorus says that `it is sign of a gentle heart<br>
when a man loves and desires to have a good name.'<br>
And therefore says Saint Austin that `there are two things that are necessary and needful,<br>
and that is good conscience and good reputation;<br>
that is to say, good conscience to thine own person inward and good reputation for thy neighbor outward.'<br>
And he that trusts himself so much in his good conscience<br>
that he displeases, and sets at naught his good name or reputation,<br>
and cares not though he keep not his good name, is but a cruel churl.<br>
"Sir, now have I showed you how you shall do in getting riches, and how you shall use them,<br>
and I see well that for the trust that you have in your riches<br>
you will provoke war and battle.<br>
I advise you that you begin no war in trust of your riches,<br>
for they do not suffice to maintain wars.<br>
And therefore says a philosopher, `That man who desires and will continually have war, shall never have enough,<br>
for the richer that he is, the greater expenditures must he make, if he will have worship and victory.'<br>
And Solomon says that `the greater riches that a man has, the more spenders he has.'<br>
And, dear sir, although it be so that for your riches you can have much folk,<br>
yet it is not suitable, nor is it any good, to begin war whereas you can<br>
in another manner have peace unto your honor and advantage.<br>
For the victory of battles that are in this world lies not in great number or multitude<br>
of the people, nor in the strength of man,<br>
but it lies in the will and in the hand of our Lord God Almighty.<br>
And therefore Judas Machabeus, who was God's knight,<br>
when he had to fight against his adversary who has a greater number<br>
and a greater multitude of folk and stronger than was this people of Machabee,<br>
yet he comforted his little company, and said exactly in this way:<br>
`As easily,' said he, `may our Lord God Almighty give victory to a few folk as to many folk,<br>
for the victory of a battle comes not by the great number of people,<br>
but it comes from our Lord God of heaven.'<br>
And, dear sir, since there is no man certain if he be worthy that<br>
God give him victory . . . or not, according to what Solomon says,<br>
therefore every man should greatly dread to begin wars.<br>
And because in battles many perils befall,<br>
and happens another time that as soon is the great man slain as the little man;<br>
and as it is written in the second Book of Kings,<br>
`The deeds of battles are subject to chance and in no way certain,<br>
for as easily is one hurt with one spear as another';<br>
and for there is great peril in war, therefore should a man flee and shun war,<br>
insomuch as a man may goodly (do so).<br>
For Solomon says, `He who loves peril shall fall in peril.'"<br>
After Dame Prudence had spoken in this manner, Melibee answered and said,<br>
"I see well, dame Prudence, that by your fair words and by your reasons<br>
that you have showed me, that the war not at all pleases you;<br>
but I have not yet heard your advice, how I shall do in this urgent matter."<br>
"Certainly," said she, "I advise you that you agree with your adversaries and that you have peace with them.<br>
For Saint James says in his Epistles that `by agreeent and peace the small riches wax great,<br>
and by debate and discord the great riches fall down.'<br>
And you know well that one of the greatest and most excellent things<br>
that is in this world is unity and peace.<br>
And therefore said our Lord Jesus Christ to his apostles in this manner:<br>
`Well happy and blessed are they that love and bring about peace, for they are called children of God.'"<br> 
"A," said Melibee, "now see I well that you love not my honor nor my worthiness.<br>
You know well that my adversaries have begun this debate and strife by their outrage,<br>
and you see well that they neither require nor pray me for peace,<br>
nor they ask not to be reconciled.<br>
Will you then that I go and humble myself, and be subject to them, and beg them for mercy?<br>
Indeed, that would not be to my honor.<br> 
For just as men say that `over-great familiarity engenders contempt,' <br>
so fares it by too great humility or meekness."<br>
Then began dame Prudence to make the outward appearance of wrath and said:<br>
"Certainly, sir, with all due respect to you, I love your honor and your well-being<br>
as I do my own, and ever have done;<br>
nor you, nor any other, can say never the contrary.<br>
And yet if I had said that you should have brought about the peace<br>
and the reconciliation, I had not much mistaken me nor said amiss.<br>
For the wise man says, `The dissension begins by another man,<br> 
And the prophet says, `Flee shrewdness and do goodness;<br>
seek peace and follow it, as much as in thee is.'<br>
Yet say I not that you should rather sue to your adversaries for peace than they should (offer peace) to you.<br>
For I know well that you are so hard-hearted that you will do nothing for me.<br>
And Solomon says, `He that has over-hard a heart, at the last he shall have bad luck and suffer misfortune.'"<br>
When Melibee had heard dame Prudence make the appearance of wrath, he said in this manner:<br>
"Dame, I pray you that you be not displeased by things that I say,<br>
for you know well that I am angry and wrathful, and that is no wonder;<br>
and they that are wrathful know not well what they do nor what they say.<br>
Therefore the prophet says that `troubled eyes have no clear sight.'<br>
But say and advise me as you like, for I am ready to do just as you will desire;<br>
and if you reprove me for my folly,<br>
I am the more obligated to love you and to praise you.<br>
For Solomon says that `he that reproves him who does folly,<br>
he shall find greater grace than he who deceives him by sweet words.'"<br>
Then said dame Prudence, "I make no outward appearance of wrath nor anger, but for your great advantage.<br>
For Solomon says, `He is more worthy that reproves or chides a fool for his folly,<br>
showing him the outward appearance of wrath, <br>
than he who supports him and praises him in his misdoing and laughs at his folly.'<br>
And this same Solomon says afterward that<br>
`by the sorrowful visage of a man'<br>
(that is to say by the sorry and heavy countenance of a man)<br>
`the fool corrects and amends himself.'"<br>
Then said Melibee, "I shall not know how to answer to<br>
so many fair reasons as you set forth and show to me.<br>
Say shortly your will and your advice, and I am all ready to fulfill and perform it."<br>
Then dame Prudence uncovered all her will to him and said,<br>
"I advise you," said she, "above all things , that you make peace between God and you,<br>
and are reconciled unto him and to his grace.<br>
For, as I have said to you here before this, God has allowed you<br>
to have this tribulation and suffering for your sins.<br>
And if you do as I tell you, God will send your adversaries unto you<br>
and make them fall at your feet, ready to do your will and your commandments.<br>
For Solomon says, `When the condition of man is pleasant and pleasing to God,<br>
he changes the hearts of the man's adversaries and constrains them to beseech him for peace and for grace.'<br>
And I pray you let me speak with your adversaries in a private place,<br>
for they must not know that it is of your will or of your assent.<br>
And then, when I know their will and their intent, I can advise you the more surely."<br>
"Dame," said Melibee, "do your will and your pleasure;<br>
for I put me wholly in your disposition and ordinance."<br>
Then dame Prudence, when she saw the good will of her husband, considered and pondered in herself,<br>
thinking how she might bring this urgent matter unto a good conclusion and to a good end.<br>
And when she saw her time, she sent for these adversaries to come unto her into a private place<br>
and showed wisely unto them the great goods that come of peace<br>
and the great harms and perils that are in war,<br>
and said to them in a goodly manner how that they ought to have great repentance<br>
for the injury and wrong that they had done to Melibee her lord,<br>
and unto her, and to her daughter.<br>
And when they heard the goodly words of dame Prudence,<br>
they were so taken and ravished and had such great joy of her that it was a wonder to tell.<br>
"A, lady," said they, "you have showed unto us the blessing of sweetness,<br>
according to the saying of David the prophet,<br>
for the reconciliation which we are not worthy to have in any manner,<br>
but we ought to request it with great contrition and humility,<br>
that you of your great goodness have presented unto us.<br>
Now see we well that the knowledge and the cunning of Solomon is very true.<br>
For he says that `sweet words multiply and increase friends<br> 
and make scoundrels to be gentle and meek.'<br>
"Certainly," said they, "we put our actions and all our matters and cause all wholly in your good will<br>
and are ready to obey to the speech and commandment of my lord <br>
And therefore, dear and benign lady, we pray you and beseech you as meekly as we know how and are able<br>
that it be pleasing unto your great goodness to fulfill in deed your goodly words,<br>
for we consider and acknowledge that we have offended and grieved my lord Melibee out of measure,<br>
so far that we are not of power to make his amends.<br>
And therefore we pledge and bind us and our friends to do all his will and his commandments.<br>
But perhaps he has such heaviness and such wrath toward us because of our offense<br>
that he will impose on us such a punishment as we can not bear nor sustain.<br>
And therefore, noble lady, we beseech to your womanly pity<br>
to take such thought in this urgent matter that<br>
we nor our friends are not dispossessed nor destroyed through our folly."<br>
"Certainly," said Prudence, "it is a hard thing and very perilous<br>
that a man put himself entirely in the power of decision and judgment,<br>
and in the might and power of his enemies.<br>
For Solomon says, `Believe me, and give credence to what I shall say: I say,' said he,<br>
`you people, folk and governors of holy church,<br>
to thy son, to thy wife, to thy friend, nor to thy brother<br>
give thou never power (over) nor mastery of thy body while thou livest.'<br>
Now since he forbids that a man should give to his brother<br>
nor to his friend the control of his body,<br>
by a stronger reason he prohibits and forbids a man to give himself to his enemy.<br>
And nevertheless I advise you that you mistrust not my lord,<br>
for I know well and know truly that he is gentle and humble, generous, courteous,<br>
and in no way desirous nor covetous of goods nor riches.<br>
For there is nothing in this world that he desires, save only worship and honor.<br>
Furthermore I know well and am very sure that he shall do nothing in this urgent matter without my advice,<br>
and I shall so work in this cause that by the grace of our Lord God<br>
you shall be reconciled unto us."<br>
Then said they with one voice, "Worshipful lady, we put us<br>
and our goods all fully in your will and power,<br>
and are ready to come, what day that it pleases unto your noblesse to limit us or assign us,<br>
to make our pledge and bond as strong as it pleases unto your goodness,<br>
that we may fulfill the will of you and of my lord Melibee."<br>
When dame Prudence had heard the answers of these men, she bad them go again secretly;<br>
and she returned to her lord Melibee, and told him how she found his adversaries very repentant,<br>
acknowledging very lowly their sins and trespass, and how they were ready to suffer any punishment,<br>
requesting and praying him of mercy and pity.<br>
Then said Melibee: "He is well worthy to have pardon<br>
and forgiveness of his sin, who does not excuse his sin<br>
but acknowledges it and repents himself, asking indulgence.<br>
For Seneca says, `There is the remission and forgiveness, where the confession is,'<br>
for confession is neighbor to innocence.<br>
And he says in another place that `he who has shame of his sin and acknowledges<br>
[it is worthy of having remission].' And therefore I assent and resolve myself to have peace;<br>
but it is good that we do it not without the assent and will of our friends."<br>
Then was Prudence very glad and joyful and said:<br>
"Certainly, sir," said she, "you have well and goodly answered,<br>
for just as by the advice, assent, and help of your friends<br>
you have been stirred to avenge yourself and make war,<br>
just so without their advice shall you not reconcile yourself nor have peace with your adversaries.<br>
For the law says, `There is no thing so good in the natural course of events kind as for a thing<br>
to be unbound by him who bound it.'"<br>
And then dame Prudence without delay or tarrying sent immediately her messages for her kin<br>
and for her old friends which that were true and wise,<br>
and told them in detail in the presence of Melibee all this matter<br>
as it is above expressed and declared,<br>
and prayed them that they would give their counsel and advice what best were to do in this urgent matter.<br>
And when Melibee's friends had taken her counsel and deliberation on the foresaid matter,<br>
and had examined it by great effort and greet diligence,<br>
they gave unqualified advice to have peace and rest,<br>
and that Melibee should with good heart receive his adversaries to forgiveness and mercy.<br>
And when dame Prudence had heard the assent of her lord Melibee, and the advice of his friends<br>
agree with her will and her intention,<br>
she was wonderfully glad in her heart and said:<br>
"There is an old proverb," said she, "which says that `the goodness that thou can do this day, do it,<br>
and abide not nor delay it not till tomorrow.'<br>
And therefore I advise that you send your messengers, such as are discrete and wise,<br>
unto your adversaries, telling them on your behalf<br>
that if they will negotiate about peace and about harmony,<br>
that they prepare themselves without delay or tarrying to come unto us."<br>
Which thing was carried out in deed.<br>
And when these trespassers and folk repenting of their follies<br>
-- that is to say, the adversaries of Melibee --<br>
had heard what these messengers said unto them,<br>
they were just glad and joyful, and answered very meekly and benignly,<br>
yielding thanks and gratitude to their lord Melibee and to all his company,<br>
and prepared themselves without delay to go with the messengers <br>
and obey to the command of their lord Melibee.<br>
And right away they took their way to the court of Melibee,<br>
and took with them some of their true friends<br>
to stand surety for them and to be their guarantors.<br>
And when they were come to the presence of Melibee, he said to them these words:<br>
"It stands thus," said Melibee, "and true it is, that you,<br>
causeless and without logical explanation and reason,<br>
have done great injuries and wrongs to me and to my wife Prudence and to my daughter also.<br>
For you have entered into my house by violence,<br>
and have done such outrage that all men know well that you have deserved the death.<br>
And therefore will I know and learn of you<br>
whether you will put the punishment and the chastising and the vengeance of this outrage in the power<br>
of me and of my wife Prudence, or will you not?"<br>
Then the wisest of them three answered for them all and said,<br>
"Sir," said he, "we know well that we are unworthy to come unto the court<br>
of so great a lord and so worthy as you are.<br>
For we have so greatly transgressed, and have offended<br>
and done wrong in such a way against your high lordship<br>
that truly we have deserved the death.<br>
But yet, for the great goodness and gentleness that all the world witnesses of your person,<br>
we submit ourselves to the excellence and benignity of your gracious lordship,<br>
and are ready to obey all your commandments,<br>
beseeching you that of your merciful pity<br> 
you will consider our great repentance and low submission<br>
and grant us forgiveness of our outrageous trespass and offense.<br>
For well we know that your liberal grace and mercy<br>
stretch themselves farther into goodness than do our outrageous guilts and trespass into wickedness,<br>
although it be so that cursedly and damnably we have sinned against your high lordship."<br>
Then Melibee took them up from the ground very benignly,<br>
and received their pledges and their bonds by their oaths upon their pledges and guarantors,<br>
and assigned them a certain day to return unto his court<br>
to accept and receive the sentence and judgment that Melibee would command<br>
to be done on them by the causes aforesaid.<br>
Which things arranged, every man returned to his house.<br>
And when dame Prudence saw her time, she questioned and asked her lord Melibee<br>
what vengeance he thought to take upon his adversaries.<br>
To which Melibee answered and said, "Certainly," said he, "I think and purpose me fully<br>
to dispossess them of all that ever they have and to put them in exile for ever."<br>
"Certainly," said dame Prudence, "this would be a cruel sentence and much again reason.<br>
For you are rich enough and have no need of other men's wealth,<br>
and you might easily in this way get yourself a covetous name,<br>
which is a vicious thing, and ought to be shunned by every good man.<br>
For according to the saying of the word of the Apostle, `Greed is root of all harms.'<br>
And therefore it were better for you to lose so much wealth of your own<br>
than to take their wealth in this manner,<br>
for better it is to lose wealth with honor than it is to acquire wealth with villainy and shame.<br>
And every man ought to do his best efforts and his main concern to get himself a good name.<br>
And yet shall he not only busy himself in keeping of his good name,<br>
but he shall also strive always to do something by which he may renew his good name.<br>
For it is written that `the old good reputation or good name of a man is soon gone<br>
and passed, when it is not renewed nor restored.'<br>
And as touching that you say you will exile your adversaries,<br>
that thinks me much against reason and out of measure,<br>
considered the power that they have given you upon themselves.<br>
And it is written that `he is worthy to lose his privilege that misuses<br>
the might and the power that is given him.'<br>
And I assume (for the sake of argument) you might impose on them that punishment by justice and by law,<br>
which I believe you can not do;<br>
I say perhaps you could not put it to execution,<br>
and then it would be likely to return to the war as it was before.<br>
And therefore, if you want men to do you obedience, you must judge more courteously;<br>
this is to say, you must give more easy sentences and judgments.<br>
For it is written that `he who most courteously commands, to him men most obey.'<br>
And therefore I pray you that in this necessity and in this urgent matter  <br>
you endeavor to overcome your heart.<br>
For Seneca says that `he that overcomes his heart overcomes twice.'<br>
And Cicero says, `There is no thing so commendable in a great lord<br>
as when he is gentle and meek, and calms himself easily.<br>
And I pray you that you will forbear now to do vengeance,<br>
in such a manner that your good name may be kept and conserved,<br>
and that men may have cause and matter to praise you for pity and for mercy,<br>
and that you have no cause to repent yourself of thing that you do.<br>
For Seneca says, `He overcomes in an evil manner who repents himself of his victory.'<br>
Wherefore I pray you, let mercy be in your heart,<br>
to the effect and intent that God Almighty have mercy on you in his last judgment.<br>
For Saint James says in his Epistle: `Judgment without mercy shall be done<br>
to him that has no mercy for another person.'"<br>
</b>When Melibee had heard the great logical arguments and reasons of<br> 
dame Prudence, and her wise counsels and teachings,<br>
his heart began to incline to the will of his wife, considering her true intent,<br>
and conformed him immediately and assented fully to work according to her advice,<br>
and thanked God, of whom proceeds all virtue and all goodness,<br>
that sent him a wife of so great discretion.<br>
And when the day came that his adversaries should appear in his presence,<br>
he spoke unto them very goodly, and said in this manner:<br>
"Although it be so that of your pride and high presumption<br> 
and folly, and of your negligence and ignorance,<br>
you have misbehaved yourself and trespassed unto me,<br>
yet forasmuch as I see and behold your great humility<br>
and that you are sorry and repentant of your guilts,<br>
it constrains me to do you grace and mercy.<br>
Wherefore I receive you to my grace<br>
and forgive you completely all the offenses, injuries, and <br>
wrongs that you have done against me and mine,<br>
to this effect and to this end, that God of his endless mercy<br>
will at the time of our dying forgive us our guilts<br>
that we have trespassed to him in this wretched world.<br>
For doubtless, if we are sorry and repentant of the sins and guilts which we have trespassed<br>
in the sight of our Lord God,<br>
he is so free and so merciful<br>
that he will forgive us our guilts<br>
and bring us to the bliss that never has end." Amen.<br>
