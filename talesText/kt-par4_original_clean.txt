Greet was the feeste in Atthenes that day,

And eek the lusty seson of that May

Made every wight to been in swich plesaunce

That al that Monday justen they and daunce,

And spenden it in Venus heigh servyse.

But by the cause that they sholde ryse

Eerly, for to seen the grete fight,

Unto hir reste wenten they at nyght.

And on the morwe, whan that day gan sprynge,

Of hors and harneys noyse and claterynge

Ther was in hostelryes al aboute,

And to the paleys rood ther many a route

Of lordes upon steedes and palfreys.

Ther maystow seen devisynge of harneys

So unkouth and so riche, and wroght so weel

Of goldsmythrye, of browdynge, and of steel;

The sheeldes brighte, testeres, and trappures,

Gold-hewen helmes, coats of mail, cote-armures;

Lordes in parementz on hir courseres,

Knyghtes of retenue, and eek squieres

Nailynge the speres, and helmes bokelynge;

Giggynge of sheeldes, with layneres lacynge --

There as nede is they weren no thyng ydel;

The fomy steedes on the golden brydel

Gnawynge, and faste the armurers also

With fyle and hamer prikynge to and fro;

Yemen on foote, and communes many oon

With shorte staves, thikke as they may goon;

Pypes, trompes, nakers, clariounes,

That in the bataille blowen blody sounes;

The paleys ful of peple up and doun,

Heere thre, ther ten, holdynge hir questioun,

Dyvynynge of thise Thebane knyghtes two.

Somme seyden thus, somme seyde "it shal be so";

Somme helden with hym with the blake berd,

Somme with the balled, somme with the thikke herd;

Somme seyde he looked grymme, and he wolde fighte:

"He hath a sparth of twenty pound of wighte."

Thus was the halle ful of divynynge,

Longe after that the sonne gan to sprynge.

The grete Theseus, that of his sleep awaked

With mynstralcie and noyse that was maked,

Heeld yet the chambre of his paleys riche

Til that the Thebane knyghtes, bothe yliche

Honured, were into the paleys fet.

Duc Theseus was at a wyndow set,

Arrayed right as he were a god in trone.

The peple preesseth thiderward ful soone

Hym for to seen, and doon heigh reverence,

And eek to herkne his heste and his sentence.

An heraud on a scaffold made an "Oo!"

Til al the noyse of peple was ydo,

And whan he saugh the peple of noyse al stille,

Tho shewed he the myghty dukes wille:

"The lord hath of his heigh discrecioun

Considered that it were destruccioun

To gentil blood to fighten in the gyse

Of mortal bataille now in this emprise.

Wherfore, to shapen that they shal nat dye,

He wol his firste purpos modifye.

No man therfore, up peyne of los of lyf,

No maner shot, ne polax, ne short knyf

Into the lystes sende or thider brynge;

Ne short swerd, for to stoke with poynt bitynge,

No man ne drawe, ne bere it by his syde.

Ne no man shal unto his felawe ryde

But o cours with a sharpe ygrounde spere;

Foyne, if hym list, on foote, hymself to were.

And he that is at meschief shal be take

And noght slayn, but be broght unto the stake

That shal ben ordeyned on either syde;

But thider he shal by force, and there abyde.

And if so falle the chieftayn be take

On outher syde, or elles sleen his make,

No lenger shal the turneiynge laste.

God spede you! Gooth forth and ley on faste!

With long swerd and with mace fighteth youre fille.

Gooth now youre wey; this is the lordes wille."

The voys of peple touchede the hevene,

So loude cride they with murie stevene,

"God save swich a lord, that is so good

He wilneth no destruccion of blood!"

Up goon the trompes and the melodye,

And to the lystes rit the compaignye,

By ordinance, thurghout the citee large,

Hanged with clooth of gold, and nat with sarge.

Ful lik a lord this noble duc gan ryde,

Thise two Thebans upon either syde,

And after rood the queene and Emelye,

And after that another compaignye

Of oon and oother, after hir degree.

And thus they passen thurghout the citee,

And to the lystes come they by tyme.

It nas nat of the day yet fully pryme

Whan set was Theseus ful riche and hye,

Ypolita the queene, and Emelye,

And othere ladys in degrees aboute.

Unto the seetes preesseth al the route.

And westward, thurgh the gates under Marte,

Arcite, and eek the hondred of his parte,

With baner reed is entred right anon;

And in that selve moment Palamon

Is under Venus, estward in the place,

With baner whyt and hardy chiere and face.

In al the world, to seken up and doun,

So evene, withouten variacioun,

Ther nere swiche compaignyes tweye,

For ther was noon so wys that koude seye

That any hadde of oother avauntage

Of worthynesse, ne of estaat, ne age,

So evene were they chosen, for to gesse.

And in two renges faire they hem dresse.

Whan that hir names rad were everichon,

That in hir nombre gyle were ther noon,

Tho were the gates shet, and cried was loude:

"Do now youre devoir, yonge knyghtes proude!"

The heraudes lefte hir prikyng up and doun;

Now ryngen trompes loude and clarioun.

Ther is namoore to seyn, but west and est

In goon the speres ful sadly in arrest;

In gooth the sharpe spore into the syde.

Ther seen men who kan juste and who kan ryde;

Ther shyveren shaftes upon sheeldes thikke;

He feeleth thurgh the herte-spoon the prikke.

Up spryngen speres twenty foot on highte;

Out goon the swerdes as the silver brighte;

The helmes they tohewen and toshrede;

Out brest the blood with stierne stremes rede;

With myghty maces the bones they tobreste.

He thurgh the thikkeste of the throng gan threste;

Ther stomblen steedes stronge, and doun gooth al,

He rolleth under foot as dooth a bal;

He foyneth on his feet with his tronchoun,

And he hym hurtleth with his hors adoun;

He thurgh the body is hurt and sithen ytake,

Maugree his heed, and broght unto the stake;

As forward was, right there he moste abyde.

Another lad is on that oother syde.

And some tyme dooth hem Theseus to reste,

Hem to refresshe and drynken, if hem leste.

Ful ofte a day han thise Thebanes two

Togydre ymet, and wroght his felawe wo;

Unhorsed hath ech oother of hem tweye.

Ther nas no tygre in the vale of Galgopheye,

Whan that hir whelp is stole whan it is lite,

So crueel on the hunte as is Arcite

For jelous herte upon this Palamon.

Ne in Belmarye ther nys so fel leon,

That hunted is, or for his hunger wood,

Ne of his praye desireth so the blood,

As Palamon to sleen his foo Arcite.

The jelous strokes on hir helmes byte;

Out renneth blood on bothe hir sydes rede.

Som tyme an ende ther is of every dede.

For er the sonne unto the reste wente,

The stronge kyng Emetreus gan hente

This Palamon, as he faught with Arcite,

And made his swerd depe in his flessh to byte,

And by the force of twenty is he take

Unyolden, and ydrawen to the stake.

And in the rescus of this Palamoun

The stronge kyng Lygurge is born adoun,

And kyng Emetreus, for al his strengthe,

Is born out of his sadel a swerdes lengthe,

So hitte him Palamoun er he were take.

But al for noght; he was broght to the stake.

His hardy herte myghte hym helpe naught:

He moste abyde, whan that he was caught,

By force and eek by composicioun.

Who sorweth now but woful Palamoun,

That moot namoore goon agayn to fighte?

And whan that Theseus hadde seyn this sighte,

Unto the folk that foghten thus echon

He cryde, "Hoo! namoore, for it is doon!

I wol be trewe juge, and no partie.

Arcite of Thebes shal have Emelie,

That by his fortune hath hire faire ywonne."

Anon ther is a noyse of peple bigonne

For joye of this, so loude and heighe withalle

It semed that the lystes sholde falle.

What kan now faire Venus doon above?

What seith she now? What dooth this queene of love,

But wepeth so, for wantynge of hir wille,

Til that hir teeres in the lystes fille?

She seyde, "I am ashamed, doutelees."

Saturnus seyde, "Doghter, hoold thy pees!

Mars hath his wille, his knyght hath al his boone,

And, by myn heed, thow shalt been esed soone."

The trompours, with the loude mynstralcie,

The heraudes, that ful loude yelle and crie,

Been in hire wele for joye of daun Arcite.

But herkneth me, and stynteth noyse a lite,

Which a myracle ther bifel anon.

This fierse Arcite hath of his helm ydon,

And on a courser, for to shewe his face,

He priketh endelong the large place

Lokynge upward upon this Emelye;

And she agayn hym caste a freendlich ye

(For wommen, as to speken in comune,

Thei folwen alle the favour of Fortune)

And was al his chiere, as in his herte.

Out of the ground a furie infernal sterte,

From Pluto sent at requeste of Saturne,

For which his hors for fere gan to turne,

And leep aside, and foundred as he leep;

And er that Arcite may taken keep,

He pighte hym on the pomel of his heed,

That in the place he lay as he were deed,

His brest tobrosten with his sadel-bowe.

As blak he lay as any cole or crowe,

So was the blood yronnen in his face.

Anon he was yborn out of the place,

With herte soor, to Theseus paleys.

Tho was he korven out of his harneys

And in a bed ybrought ful faire and blyve,

For he was yet in memorie and alyve,

And alwey criynge after Emelye.

Duc Theseus, with al his compaignye,

Is comen hoom to Atthenes his citee,

With alle blisse and greet solempnitee.

Al be it that this aventure was falle,

He nolde noght disconforten hem alle.

Men seyde eek that Arcite shal nat dye;

He shal been heeled of his maladye.

And of another thyng they weren as fayn,

That of hem alle was ther noon yslayn,

Al were they soore yhurt, and namely oon,

That with a spere was thirled his brest boon.

To othere woundes and to broken armes

Somme hadden salves, and somme hadden charmes;

Fermacies of herbes, and eek save

They dronken, for they wolde hir lymes have.

For which this noble duc, as he wel kan,

Conforteth and honoureth every man,

And made revel al the longe nyght

Unto the straunge lordes, as was right.

Ne ther was holden no disconfitynge

But as a justes or a tourneiynge;

For soothly ther was no disconfiture.

For fallyng nys nat but an aventure,

Ne to be lad by force unto the stake

Unyolden, and with twenty knyghtes take,

O persone allone, withouten mo,

And haryed forth by arme, foot, and too,

And eke his steede dryven forth with staves

With footmen, bothe yemen and eek knaves --

It nas arretted hym no vileynye;

Ther may no man clepen it cowardye.

For which anon duc Theseus leet crye,

To stynten alle rancour and envye,

The gree as wel of o syde as of oother,

And eyther syde ylik as ootheres brother;

And yaf hem yiftes after hir degree,

And fully heeld a feeste dayes three,

And conveyed the kynges worthily

Out of his toun a journee largely.

And hoom wente every man the righte way.

Ther was namoore but "Fare wel, have good day!"

Of this bataille I wol namoore endite,

But speke of Palamon and of Arcite.

Swelleth the brest of Arcite, and the soore

Encreesseth at his herte moore and moore.

The clothered blood, for any lechecraft,

Corrupteth, and is in his bouk ylaft,

That neither veyne-blood, ne ventusynge,

Ne drynke of herbes may ben his helpynge.

The vertu expulsif, or animal,

Fro thilke vertu cleped natural

Ne may the venym voyden ne expelle.

The pipes of his longes gonne to swelle,

And every lacerte in his brest adoun

Is shent with venym and corrupcioun.

Hym gayneth neither, for to gete his lif,

Vomyt upward, ne dounward laxatif.

Al is tobrosten thilke regioun;

Nature hath now no dominacioun.

And certeinly, ther Nature wol nat wirche,

Fare wel phisik! Go ber the man to chirche!

This al and som, that Arcita moot dye;

For which he sendeth after Emelye,

And Palamon, that was his cosyn deere.

Thanne seyde he thus, as ye shal after heere:

"Naught may the woful spirit in myn herte

Declare o point of alle my sorwes smerte

To yow, my lady, that I love moost,

But I biquethe the servyce of my goost

To yow aboven every creature,

Syn that my lyf may no lenger dure.

Allas, the wo! Allas, the peynes stronge,

That I for yow have suffred, and so longe!

Allas, the deeth! Allas, myn Emelye!

Allas, departynge of oure compaignye!

Allas, myn hertes queene! Allas, my wyf,

Myn hertes lady, endere of my lyf!

What is this world? What asketh men to have?

Now with his love, now in his colde grave

Allone, withouten any compaignye.

Fare wel, my sweete foo, myn Emelye!

And softe taak me in youre armes tweye,

For love of God, and herkneth what I seye.

"I have heer with my cosyn Palamon

Had strif and rancour many a day agon

For love of yow, and for my jalousye.

And Juppiter so wys my soule gye,

To speken of a servaunt proprely,

With alle circumstances trewely --

That is to seyen, trouthe, honour, knyghthede,

Wysdom, humblesse, estaat, and heigh kynrede,

Fredom, and al that longeth to that art --

So Juppiter have of my soule part,

As in this world right now ne knowe I non

So worthy to ben loved as Palamon,

That serveth yow, and wol doon al his lyf.

And if that evere ye shul ben a wyf,

Foryet nat Palamon, the gentil man."

And with that word his speche faille gan,

For from his feet up to his brest was come

The coold of deeth, that hadde hym overcome,

And yet mooreover, for in his armes two

The vital strengthe is lost and al ago.

Oonly the intellect, withouten moore,

That dwelled in his herte syk and soore,

Gan faillen whan the herte felte deeth.

Dusked his eyen two, and failled breeth,

But on his lady yet caste he his ye;

His laste word was, "Mercy, Emelye!"

His spirit chaunged hous and wente ther,

As I cam nevere, I kan nat tellen wher.

Therfore I stynte; I nam no divinistre;

Of soules fynde I nat in this registre,

Ne me ne list thilke opinions to telle

Of hem, though that they writen wher they dwelle.

Arcite is coold, ther Mars his soule gye!

Now wol I speken forth of Emelye.

Shrighte Emelye, and howleth Palamon,

And Theseus his suster took anon

Swownynge, and baar hire fro the corps away.

What helpeth it to tarien forth the day

To tellen how she weep bothe eve and morwe?

For in swich cas wommen have swich sorwe,

Whan that hir housbondes ben from hem ago,

That for the moore part they sorwen so,

Or ellis fallen in swich maladye

That at the laste certeinly they dye.

Infinite been the sorwes and the teeres

Of olde folk and folk of tendre yeeres

In al the toun for deeth of this Theban.

For hym ther wepeth bothe child and man;

So greet wepyng was ther noon, certayn,

Whan Ector was ybroght, al fressh yslayn,

To Troye. Allas, the pitee that was ther,

Cracchynge of chekes, rentynge eek of heer.

"Why woldestow be deed," thise wommen crye,

"And haddest gold ynough, and Emelye?"

No man myghte gladen Theseus,

Savynge his olde fader Egeus,

That knew this worldes transmutacioun,

As he hadde seyn it chaunge bothe up and doun,

Joye after wo, and wo after gladnesse,

And shewed hem ensamples and liknesse.

"Right as ther dyed nevere man," quod he,

"That he ne lyvede in erthe in some degree,

Right so ther lyvede never man," he seyde,

"In al this world, that som tyme he ne deyde.

This world nys but a thurghfare ful of wo,

And we been pilgrymes, passynge to and fro.

Deeth is an ende of every worldly soore."

And over al this yet seyde he muchel moore

To this effect, ful wisely to enhorte

The peple that they sholde hem reconforte.

Duc Theseus, with al his bisy cure,

Caste now wher that the sepulture

Of goode Arcite may best ymaked be,

And eek moost honurable in his degree.

And at the laste he took conclusioun

That ther as first Arcite and Palamoun

Hadden for love the bataille hem bitwene,

That in that selve grove, swoote and grene,

Ther as he hadde his amorouse desires,

His compleynte, and for love his hoote fires,

He wolde make a fyr in which the office

Funeral he myghte al accomplice.

And leet comande anon to hakke and hewe

The okes olde, and leye hem on a rewe

In colpons wel arrayed for to brenne.

His officers with swifte feet they renne

And ryde anon at his comandement.

And after this, Theseus hath ysent

After a beere, and it al overspradde

With clooth of gold, the richeste that he hadde.

And of the same suyte he cladde Arcite;

Upon his hondes hadde he gloves white,

Eek on his heed a coroune of laurer grene,

And in his hond a swerd ful bright and kene.

He leyde hym, bare the visage, on the beere;

Therwith he weep that pitee was to heere.

And for the peple sholde seen hym alle,

Whan it was day, he broghte hym to the halle,

That roreth of the criyng and the soun.

Tho cam this woful Theban Palamoun,

With flotery berd and ruggy, asshy heeres,

In clothes blake, ydropped al with teeres;

And, passynge othere of wepynge, Emelye,

The rewefulleste of al the compaignye.

In as muche as the servyce sholde be

The moore noble and riche in his degree,

Duc Theseus leet forth thre steedes brynge,

That trapped were in steel al gliterynge,

And covered with the armes of daun Arcite.

Upon thise steedes, that weren grete and white,

Ther seten folk, of whiche oon baar his sheeld,

Another his spere up on his hondes heeld,

The thridde baar with hym his bowe Turkeys

(Of brend gold was the caas and eek the harneys);

And riden forth a paas with sorweful cheere

Toward the grove, as ye shul after heere.

The nobleste of the Grekes that ther were

Upon hir shuldres caryeden the beere,

With slakke paas and eyen rede and wete,

Thurghout the citee by the maister strete,

That sprad was al with blak, and wonder hye

Right of the same is the strete ywrye.

Upon the right hond wente olde Egeus,

And on that oother syde duc Theseus,

With vessels in hir hand of gold ful fyn,

Al ful of hony, milk, and blood, and wyn;

Eek Palamon, with ful greet compaignye;

And after that cam woful Emelye,

With fyr in honde, as was that tyme the gyse,

To do the ritual of funeral service.

Heigh labour and ful greet apparaillynge

Was at the service and the fyr-makynge,

That with his grene top the hevene raughte;

And twenty fadme of brede the armes straughte --

This is to seyn, the bowes weren so brode.

Of stree first ther was leyd ful many a lode.

But how the fyr was maked upon highte,

Ne eek the names that the trees highte,

As ook, firre, birch, aspe, alder, holm, popler,

Wylugh, elm, plane, assh, box, chasteyn, lynde, laurer,

Mapul, thorn, bech, hasel, ew, whippeltree --

How they weren feld shal nat be toold for me;

Ne hou the goddes ronnen up and doun,

Disherited of hire habitacioun,

In which they woneden in reste and pees,

Nymphes, fawnes and amadrides;

Ne hou the beestes and the briddes alle

Fledden for fere, whan the wode was falle;

Ne how the ground agast was of the light,

That was nat wont to seen the sonne bright;

Ne how the fyr was couched first with stree,

And thanne with drye stikkes cloven a thre,

And thanne with grene wode and spicerye,

And thanne with clooth of gold and with perrye,

And gerlandes, hangynge with ful many a flour;

The mirre, th'encens, with al so greet odour;

Ne how Arcite lay among al this,

Ne what richesse aboute his body is;

Ne how that Emelye, as was the gyse,

Putte in the fyr of funeral servyse;

Ne how she swowned whan men made the fyr,

Ne what she spak, ne what was hir desir;

Ne what jeweles men in the fyre caste,

Whan that the fyr was greet and brente faste;

Ne how somme caste hir sheeld, and somme hir spere,

And of hire vestimentz, whiche that they were,

And coppes fulle of wyn, and milk, and blood,

Into the fyr, that brente as it were wood;

Ne how the Grekes, with an huge route,

Thries riden al the fyr aboute

Upon the left hand, with a loud shoutynge,

And thries with hir speres claterynge;

And thries how the ladyes gonne crye;

And how that lad was homward Emelye;

Ne how Arcite is brent to asshen colde;

Ne how that lyche-wake was yholde

Al thilke nyght; ne how the Grekes pleye

The wake-pleyes; ne kepe I nat to seye

Who wrastleth best naked with oille enoynt,

Ne who that baar hym best, in no disjoynt.

I wol nat tellen eek how that they goon

Hoom til Atthenes, whan the pley is doon;

But shortly to the point thanne wol I wende

And maken of my longe tale an ende.

By processe and by lengthe of certeyn yeres,

Al stynted is the moornynge and the teres

Of Grekes, by oon general assent.

Thanne semed me ther was a parlement

At Atthenes, upon certein pointz and caas;

Among the whiche pointz yspoken was,

To have with certein contrees alliaunce,

And have fully of Thebans obeisaunce.

For which this noble Theseus anon

Leet senden after gentil Palamon,

Unwist of hym what was the cause and why,

But in his blake clothes sorwefully

He cam at his comandement in hye.

Tho sente Theseus for Emelye.

Whan they were set, and hust was al the place,

And Theseus abiden hadde a space

Er any word cam fram his wise brest,

His eyen sette he ther as was his lest.

And with a sad visage he siked stille,

And after that right thus he seyde his wille:

"The Firste Moevere of the cause above,

Whan he first made the faire cheyne of love,

Greet was th'effect, and heigh was his entente.

Wel wiste he why, and what thereof he mente,

For with that faire cheyne of love he bond

The fyr, the eyr, the water, and the lond

In certeyn boundes, that they may nat flee.

That same Prince and that Moevere," quod he,

"Hath stablissed in this wrecched world adoun

Certeyne dayes and duracioun

To al that is engendred in this place,

Over the whiche day they may nat pace,

Al mowe they yet tho dayes wel abregge.

Ther nedeth noght noon auctoritee t'allegge,

For it is preeved by experience,

But that me list declaren my sentence.

Thanne may men by this ordre wel discerne

That thilke Moevere stable is and eterne.

Wel may men knowe, but it be a fool,

That every part dirryveth from his hool,

For nature hath nat taken his bigynnyng

Of no partie or cantel of a thyng,

But of a thyng that parfit is and stable,

Descendynge so til it be corrumpable.

And therfore, of his wise purveiaunce,

He hath so wel biset his ordinaunce

That speces of thynges and progressiouns

Shullen enduren by successiouns,

And nat eterne, withouten any lye.

This maystow understonde and seen at ye.

"Loo the ook, that hath so long a norisshynge

From tyme that it first bigynneth to sprynge,

And hath so long a lif, as we may see,

Yet at the laste wasted is the tree.

"Considereth eek how that the harde stoon

Under oure feet, on which we trede and goon,

Yet wasteth it as it lyth by the weye.

The brode ryver somtyme wexeth dreye;

The grete tounes se we wane and wende.

Thanne may ye se that al this thyng hath ende.

"Of man and womman seen we wel also

That nedes, in oon of thise termes two --

This is to seyn, in youthe or elles age --

He moot be deed, the kyng as shal a page;

Som in his bed, som in the depe see,

Som in the large feeld, as men may see;

Ther helpeth noght; al goth that ilke weye.

Thanne may I seyn that al this thyng moot deye.

"What maketh this but Juppiter, the kyng,

That is prince and cause of alle thyng,

Convertynge al unto his propre welle

From which it is dirryved, sooth to telle?

And heer-agayns no creature on lyve,

Of no degree, availleth for to stryve.

"Thanne is it wysdom, as it thynketh me,

To maken vertu of necessitee,

And take it weel that we may nat eschue,

And namely that to us alle is due.

And whoso gruccheth ought, he dooth folye,

And rebel is to hym that al may gye.

And certeinly a man hath moost honour

To dyen in his excellence and flour,

Whan he is siker of his goode name;

Thanne hath he doon his freend, ne hym, no shame.

And gladder oghte his freend been of his deeth,

Whan with honour up yolden is his breeth,

Than whan his name apalled is for age,

For al forgeten is his vassellage.

Thanne is it best, as for a worthy fame,

To dyen whan that he is best of name.

"The contrarie of al this is wilfulnesse.

Why grucchen we, why have we hevynesse,

That goode Arcite, of chivalrie flour,

Departed is with duetee and honour

Out of this foule prisoun of this lyf?

Why grucchen heere his cosyn and his wyf

Of his welfare, that loved hem so weel?

Kan he hem thank? Nay, God woot, never a deel,

That both his soule and eek hemself offende,

And yet they mowe hir lustes nat amende.

"What may I conclude of this longe serye,

But after wo I rede us to be merye

And thanken Juppiter of al his grace?

And er that we departen from this place

I rede that we make of sorwes two

O parfit joye, lastynge everemo.

And looketh now, wher moost sorwe is herinne,

Ther wol we first amenden and bigynne.

"Suster," quod he, "this is my fulle assent,

With al th'avys heere of my parlement,

That gentil Palamon, youre owene knyght,

That serveth yow with wille, herte, and myght,

And ever hath doon syn ye first hym knewe,

That ye shul of youre grace upon hym rewe,

And taken hym for housbonde and for lord.

Lene me youre hond, for this is oure accord.

Lat se now of youre wommanly pitee.

He is a kynges brother sone, pardee;

And though he were a povre bacheler,

Syn he hath served yow so many a yeer,

And had for yow so greet adversitee,

It moste been considered, leeveth me,

For gentil mercy oghte to passen right."

Thanne seyde he thus to Palamon the knight:

"I trowe ther nedeth litel sermonyng

To make yow assente to this thyng.

Com neer, and taak youre lady by the hond."

Bitwixen hem was maad anon the bond

That highte matrimoigne or mariage,

By al the conseil and the baronage.

And thus with alle blisse and melodye

Hath Palamon ywedded Emelye.

And God, that al this wyde world hath wroght,

Sende hym his love that hath it deere aboght;

For now is Palamon in alle wele,

Lyvynge in blisse, in richesse, and in heele,

And Emelye hym loveth so tendrely,

And he hire serveth so gentilly,

That nevere was ther no word hem bitwene

Of jalousie or any oother teene.

Thus endeth Palamon and Emelye;

And God save al this faire compaignye! Amen.
