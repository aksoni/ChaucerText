1422 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<B>Wel koude he hewen wode, and water bere,</B><BR>
1423 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<B>For he was yong and myghty for the nones,</B><BR>
1424 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<B>And therto he was long and big of bones</B><BR>
1425 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<B>To doon that any wight kan hym devyse.</B><BR>
1426 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<B>A yeer or two he was in this servyse,</B><BR>

1430 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<B>Ne was ther nevere in court of his degree;</B><BR>
1431 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<B>He was so gentil of condicioun</B><BR>
1432 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<B>That thurghout al the court was his renoun.</B><BR>
1433 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<B>They seyden that it were a charitee</B><BR>
1434 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<B>That Theseus wolde enhauncen his degree,</B><BR>

1438 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<B>Bothe of his dedes and his goode tonge,</B><BR>
1439 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<B>That Theseus hath taken hym so neer</B><BR>
1440 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<B>That of his chambre he made hym a squier,</B><BR>
1441 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<B>And gaf hym gold to mayntene his degree.</B><BR>
1442 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<B>And eek men broghte hym out of his contree,</B><BR>
1443 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<B>From yeer to yeer, ful pryvely his rente;</B><BR>
1444 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<B>But honestly and slyly he it spente,</B><BR>
1445 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<B>That no man wondred how that he it hadde.</B><BR>
1446 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<B>And thre yeer in this wise his lif he ladde,</B><BR>
1447 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<B>And bar hym so, in pees and eek in werre,</B><BR>
1448 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<B>Ther was no man that Theseus hath derre.</B><BR>
1449 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<B>And in this blisse lete I now Arcite,</B><BR>

1456 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<B>That wood out of his wit he goth for wo?</B><BR>
1457 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<B>And eek therto he is a prisoner</B><BR>

1469 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<B>And fleeth the citee faste as he may go.</B><BR>
1470 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<B>For he hadde yeve his gayler drynke so</B><BR>
