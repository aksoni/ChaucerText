&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When all this miracle was told, every man<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Was so sober that it was wonderful to see,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Until our Host then began to joke <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  And then for the first time he looked at me,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  And said thus: "What sort of man art thou?" said he;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Thou lookest as if thou would track a hare,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For ever upon the ground I see thee stare.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; " Approach nearer, and look up merrily.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Now make way, sirs, and let this man have room!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He in the waist is shaped as well as I;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This would be a little doll in an arm to embrace<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For any woman, small and fair of face.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He seems otherworldly in his behavior,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For unto no person is he sociable:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Say something now, since other folk have spoken;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Tell us a tale of mirth, and that right now."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Host," said I, "be not displeased,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For certainly I know no other tale,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Except for a riming romance I learned long ago."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Yes, that is good," said he; "now we shall hear<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Some dainty thing, it seems to me from his appearance."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Listen, my lords, with good will,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And I will tell truly <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of mirth and of pleasure,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; All about a knight who was fair and gentle<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In battle and in tournament; <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His name was sir Thopas.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He was born in a distant land,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In Flanders, far beyond the sea,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; At Popering, in that place.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His father was a very noble man,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And he was lord of that country,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Since it was God's will.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Sir Thopas grew up to be a doughty lad; <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; White was his face as fine white bread,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His lips red as a rose; <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His complexion is like scarlet deeply dyed,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And I tell you in true certainty<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He had a seemly nose.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His hair, his beard was like saffron,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That to his girdle reached down; <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His shoes of Cordovan leather.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of Bruges were his brown stockings,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His robe was of silk woven with gold,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That cost many a half-penny.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He knew how to hunt for wild animals,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And ride a-hawking for water-fowl<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With grey gos-hawk on hand; <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Moreover he was a good archer; <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In wrestling there was no one his peer,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Where any ram shall stand (as a prize).<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Very many a maid, bright in bed-chamber,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They mourn for him passionately,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When it would be better for them to sleep; <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But he was chaste and no lecher,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And sweet as is the dog rose<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That bears the red hip.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And it so happened upon a day,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In truth, as I can tell you,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Sir Thopas wanted to ride out.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He mounted upon his gray steed,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And in his hand a light lance,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A long sword by his side.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He spurs through a fair forest,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In which is many a wild best,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Yea, both buck and hare; <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And as he spurs north and east,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I tell it you, to him had almost<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Happened a grievous misfortune.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There spring herbs large and small,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The licorice and the zedoary,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And many a clove-gillyflower;  <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And nutmeg to put in ale,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Whether it be new or old,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or to lay in a clothes press.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The birds sing, it can not be denied,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The sparrow hawk and the parrot,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That it was joy to hear; <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The male thrush made also her lay,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The wood-pigeon upon the branch<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She sang very loud and clear.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Sir Thopas fell in a yearning for love,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As soon as he heard the thrush sing,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And spurred as if he were crazy.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His fair steed in his spurring<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So sweated that one could wring him; <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His sides were all blood.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Sir Thopas also so weary was<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For spurring on the soft grass,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So fierce was his heart,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That down he laid him in that place<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To give his steed some rest,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And gave him good dry fodder.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "O Saint Mary, bless me!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What does this love have against me<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To bind me so painfully?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I dreamed all this night, by God,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; An elf-queen shall be my sweetheart<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And sleep under my cloak.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "An elf-queen will I love, indeed,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For in this world no woman is<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Worthy to be my mate<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In town; <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; All other women I forsake,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And to an elf-queen I betake nyself,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; By dale and also by hill!"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Into his saddle he climbed at once,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And spurs over stile and stone<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; An elf-queen for to see,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Until he so long had ridden and walked<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That he found, in a secret place,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The country of Fairy<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So wild; <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For in that country there was no one<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who dared ride or go on foot at him,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Neither woman nor child; <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Until there came a big giant,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His name was sir Olifaunt,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A perilous man of deeds.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He said, "Child, by Termagaunt,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Unless thou spur out of my territory,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; At once I will slay thy steed<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With mace.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Here is the queen of Fairyland,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With harp and pipe and hurdy-gurdy,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Dwelling in this place."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The child said, "As I may prosper,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Tomorrow will I meet with thee,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When I have my armor; <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And yet I trust, by my faith,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That thou shalt by means of this light lance  <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Very bitterly pay for it.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thy maw<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Shall I pierce, if I can,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Ere it be fully prime of day (9 a.m.),<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For here thou shalt be slain."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Sir Thopas drew back very fast; <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This giant threw stones at him <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Out of a terrible staff-sling.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But child Thopas safely escapes,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And it was all due to God's grace,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And due to his fair bearing.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Yet listen, gentlemen, to my tale<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Merrier than the nightingale,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For now I will you tell<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; How sir Thopas, with slender waist,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Spurring over hill and dale,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Is come again to town.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His merry men commanded he<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To make him both amusement and delight,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For by necessity he must fight<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With a giant with three heads,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For love and pleasure<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of one who shone very bright.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Do come," he said, "my musicians,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And story tellers to tell tales,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Right now in my arming,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of romances that are royal,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of popes and of cardinals,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And also of the joys of love."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They fetched him first the sweet wine,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And mead also in a maple drinking bowl,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And royal delicacies<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of gingerbread that was very fine,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And licorice, and also cumin,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With sugar that is excellent.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He put on next to his white flesh<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of linen cloth fine and clear,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A pair of trousers and also a shirt; <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And next to his shirt a quilted jacket,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And over that a chain-mail shirt <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To prevent piercing of his heart; <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And over that a fine plate armor,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Which was all wrought with jewelers' work,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Very strong it was of iron plate; <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And over that his surcoat<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As white as is a lily flour,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In which he will dispute.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His shield was all of gold so red,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And on that was a boar's head,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Beside a carbuncle (red gem); <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And there he swore on ale and bread<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; How the giant shall be dead,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Whatever may happen!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His leg guards were of hardened leather,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His sword's sheath of ivory,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His helm of bright brass; <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His saddle was of ivory,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His bridle shone like the sun,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or like the moon light.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His spear was of fine cypress,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That foretells war, and nothing of peace,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The head ground very sharp; <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His steed was all dapple gray,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It goes at a slow walk on the way<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Very softly and easily<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In land.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Lo, my lords, here is a fit!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If you want to hear any more of it,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To tell it will I try<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Now hold your mouth, for kindness, please,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Both knight and noble lady,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And hearken to my tale; <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of battle and of chivalry,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And of ladies' passionate love<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Right now I will you tell.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Men speak of excellent romances,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of Horn child and of Ypotys,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of Bevis of Hampton and sir Guy of Watwick,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of sir Lybeux Desconus and Pleyndamour --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But sir Thopas, he bears the flower<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of royal chivalry!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His good steed he mounted<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And forth upon his way he glided<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Like a spark out of the burning log; <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Upon his top of his helmet he bore a tower,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And in that stuck a lily flower --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; God protect his body from shame!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And because he was a knight errent,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He would not sleep in any house,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But lie in his hood; <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His bright helm was his pillow,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And by him his war-horse grazes<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; On herbs fine and good.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He himself drank water of the well,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As did the knight sir Perceval<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So worthy in his armor,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Until on a day --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "No more of this, for God's dignity,"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Said our Host, "for thou makest me<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So weary of thy true ignorance<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That, as surely as God may bless my soul,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; My ears ache from thy crappy speech.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Now such a rime I commit to the devil!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This may well be doggerel verse," said he.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Why so?" said I, "why wilt thou prevent me<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; From telling more of my tale than another man,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Since it is the best rime I know?"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "By God," said he, "for plainly, at one word,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thy crappy riming is not worth a turd!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thou dost nothing else but waste time.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Sir, at one word, thou shalt no longer rime.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Let's see whether thou can tell anything in alliterative verse,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or tell something in prose, at the least,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In which there may be some mirth or some doctrine."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Gladly," said I, "by God's sweet pain!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I will you tell a little thing in prose<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That ought to please you, as I suppose,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or else, certainly, you are too hard to please.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It is a virtuous moral tale,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Although it is told sometimes in various ways<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; By various folk, as I shall tell you.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "As thus: you know that every Evangelist<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who tells us of the pain of Jesus Christ<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Does not say everything as his fellow does; <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But nonetheless their essential meaning is all true,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And all agree in their meaning,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Although there may be a difference in their telling.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For some of them say more, and some say less,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When they His piteous passion express --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I mean of Mark, Matthew, Luke, and John --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But doubtless their essential meaning is all the same.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Therefore, gentlemen, I beseech you,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If you think I vary as in my speech,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As thus, though I tell something more<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of proverbs than you have heard before<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Comprehended in this little treatise here,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With which to strengthen the effect of my matter; <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And though I do not say the same words<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As you have heard, yet to you all I pray<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Blame not me; for, in my essential meaning,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You shall nowhere find difference<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; From the meaning of that little treatise <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In imitation of which this merry tale I write.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And therefore hearken what I shall say,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And let me tell all my tale, I pray."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Weeping and wailing, grief and other sorrow<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I know enough, on evenings and mornings,"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Said the Merchant, "and so do many others <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who are wedded. I believe that it is so,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For well I know it fares so with me.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I have a wife, the worst that can be;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For though the fiend were married to her,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She would outmatch him, I dare well swear.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Why should I tell you in detail<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Her high malice? She is a shrew in every way.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There is a long and large difference<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Between Griselda's great patience<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And the extreme cruelty of my wife <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Were I released (from marriage), so may I may prosper,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I would never again come in the snare.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We wedded men live in sorrow and care.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Try it whoso will, and he shall find<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That I say truth, by Saint Thomas of India,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As for the greater part (majority) -- I say not all.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; God prevent that it should so happen!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "A, good sir Host, I have been wedded <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; These two months, and no more, by God;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And yet, I believe, he who all his life<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Wifeless has been, though one would him stab<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Unto the heart, could not in any way<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Tell so much sorrow as I now here<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Could tell of my wife's cursedness!"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Now," said our Host, "Merchant, as God may you bless,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Since you know so much of that art<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Full heartily I pray you tell us part."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Gladly," said he, "but of my own sorrow,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For sorry heart, I can tell no more."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Once there was dwelling in Lombardy<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A worthy knight, who was born in Pavia,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In which he lived in great prosperity;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And sixty years a wifeless man was he,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And followed always his bodily desire<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; On women, where was his appetite,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As do these fools that are secular.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And when he was passed sixty years,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Were it for holiness or for dotage<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I can not say, but such a great desire<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Had this knight to be a wedded man<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That day and night he does all he can<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To discover where he might wedded be,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Praying our Lord to grant him that he<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Might once know of that blissful life<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That is between a husband and his wife,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And to live under that holy bond<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With which God first bound man and woman.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "No other life," said he, "is worth a bean,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For wedlock is so easy and so pure,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That in this world it is a paradise."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thus said this old knight, who was so wise.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And certainly, as truly as God is king,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To take a wife it is a glorious thing,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And especially when a man is old and white-haired;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Then is a wife the best part of his treasure.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Then should he take a young wife and a fair,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; On which he might engender himself an heir,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And lead his life in joy and in pleasure,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Whereas these bachelors sing "alas,"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When they find any adversity<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In love, which is nothing but childish vanity.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And truly it is fitting to be thus,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That bachelors have often pain and woe;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; On brittle ground they build, and insecurity<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They find when they expect security.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They live but as a bird or as a beast,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In liberty and under no restraint,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Whereas a wedded man in his estate<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Lives a blissful and orderly life <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Bound under this yoke of marriage.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Well may his heart in joy and bliss abound,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For who can be so obedient as a wife?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who is so true, and also so eager <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To care for him, sick and well, as is his mate?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For happiness or woe she will not forsake him;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She is not weary of loving and serving him,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Though he lie bedridden until he dies.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And yet some clerks say it is not so,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of which that Theofrastus is one of those.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What does it matter though Theofrastus wants to lie?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Take no wife," said he, "for managing the household,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As to economize in thy household expenditures.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A true servant does more diligence<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To guard thy goods than thine own wife,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For she will claim half part all her life.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And if thou be sick, as God may save me,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thy real friends, or a true servant,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Will take care of thee better than she that waits always<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To inherit thy goods and has done so many a day.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And if thou take a wife unto thy household<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Full easily canst thou be a cuckold."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This opinion, and a hundred things worse,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Writes this man, may God his bones curse!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But take no heed of all such foolishness;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Defy Theofrastus, and listen to me.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A wife is God's gift truly;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; All other sorts of gifts certainly,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Such as lands, rents, pasture, or right to use common land,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or personal possessions -- all are gifts of Fortune<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That pass like a shadow upon a wall.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But doubt not, if I shall speak plainly:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A wife will last, and in thy house endure,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Well longer than thou will wish, indeed.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Marriage is a full great sacrament.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He who has no wife, I consider him ruined;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He lives helpless and all desolate --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I speak of folk in secular life.	<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And hearken why -- I say not this for nothing --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That woman is created for man's help.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The high God, when he had made Adam,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And saw him all alone, stark naked,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; God of his great goodness said then,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Let us now make a helper for this man<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Like to himself"; and then he made him Eve.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Here can you see, and hereby can you prove,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That wife is man's help and his comfort,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His earthly paradise, and his source of consolation.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So obedient and so virtuous is she,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They must necessarily live in unity.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; One flesh they are, and one flesh, as I guess,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Has but one heart, in prosperity and in distress.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A wife! A, Saint Mary, bless me!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; How could a man have any adversity<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That has a wife? Certainly, I can not say.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The bliss that is betwixt them two<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There can no tongue tell, nor heart think.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If he be poor, she helps him to work;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She keeps his goods, and wastes not a bit;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; All that her husband desires, well pleases her;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She says not once "nay," when he says "yea."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Do this," says he; "All ready, sir," says she.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; O blissful order of wedlock precious,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thou art so merry, and also so virtuous,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And so commended and approved also<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That every man that considers himself worth a leek<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Upon his bare knees ought all his life<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To thank his God that has sent him a wife,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or else pray to God to send him <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A wife to last unto his life's end.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For then his life is set in security;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He may not be deceived, as I guess,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Providing that he work according to his wife's advice.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Then may he boldly bear up his head,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They are so true and therewithal so wise;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For which, if thou will act like a wise man,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Do always as women will advise thee.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Lo, how Jacob, as these clerks tell,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; By good counsel of his mother Rebecca,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Bound the kid's skin about his neck,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For which his father's blessing he won.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Lo Judith, as the story also can tell,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; By wise counsel she God's people kept,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And slew that Holofernes, while he slept.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Lo Abigail, by good counsel how she<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Saved her husband Nabal when he<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Should have been slain; and look, Esther also<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; By good counsel delivered out of woe<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The people of God, and made that same Mordecai<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To be exalted by Ahasuerus.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There is no thing superior (in degree of virtue),<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As says Seneca, above a humble wife.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Submit to thy wife's tongue, as Cato bids;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She shall command, and thou shalt submit to it,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And yet she will (seem to) obey by way of courtesy.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A wife is keeper of thy household;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Well may the sick man bewail and weep,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Where there is no wife to keep the house.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I warn thee, if wisely thou wilt act,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Love well thy wife, as Christ loved his church.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If thou lovest thyself, thou lovest thy wife;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; No man hates his flesh, but in his life<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He nurtures it, and therefore I bid thee<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Cherish thy wife, or thou shalt never prosper.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Husband and wife, however much men may jest or play,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of worldly folk hold the secure way;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They are so knit together no harm can there befall,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And especially upon the wife's side.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For which this January, of whom I told,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Considered has, in his old age,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The pleasing life, the virtuous quiet,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That is in honey-sweet marriage,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And for his friends on a day he sent,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To tell them the substance of his intention.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With serious face his tale he has them told.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He said, "Friends, I am white-haired and old,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And almost, God knows, on my grave's brink;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Upon my soul somewhat must I think.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I have my body foolishly wasted;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Blessed be God that it shall be amended!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For I will be, certainly, a wedded man,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And that at once in all the haste I can (do it).<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Unto some maid fair and tender of age,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I pray yow, prepare for my marriage<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Right away, for I will not delay;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And I will attempt to discover, on my side,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To whom I may be wedded hastily.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But forasmuch as you are more than I,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You shall rather such a thing discover<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Than I, and where it would be best to ally myself (marry).<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "But one thing warn I you, my friends dear,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I will no old wife have in any way.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She shall not pass twenty years, certainly;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Old fish and young flesh would I gladly have.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Better is," said he, "a pike than a pickerel (young pike),<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And better than old beef is the tender veal.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I want no woman thirty years of age;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It is but dry bean-stalks and coarse fodder.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And also these old widows, God it knows,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They know so much trickery on Wade's boat,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Do so much harm, when they please,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That with them should I never live in rest.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For various schools make clever clerks;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A woman of many schools is half a clerk.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But certainly, one can guide a young thing,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Just as one can mold warm wax with hands.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Therefore I tell you plainly, in brief,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I will no old wife have at all for this reason.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For if it so were that I had such bad luck<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That I in her could have no pleasure,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Then I should lead my life in adultery<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And go straight to the devil when I die.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Nor any children should I upon her beget;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Yet I would rather hounds had eaten me <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Than that my heritage should fall<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In a stranger's hand, and this I tell you all.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I am not in my dotage; I know the cause why<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; One should wed, and furthermore know I<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There speaks many a man of marriage<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who knows no more of it than my servant boy knows <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For which causes man should take a wife.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If he can not live his life chastely,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Let him take him a wife with great devotion,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For the sake of lawful procreation<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of children to the honor of God above,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And not only for sexual passion or love;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And so that they should abstain from lechery,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And yield their marital debt when it is due;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or so that each of them should help the other<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In distress, as a sister shall the brother,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And live in celibacy full piously.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But sirs, by your leave, that am not I.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For -- God be thanked! -- I dare make boast<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I feel my limbs strong and sufficient<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To do all that is proper to a man;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I know myself best what I can do.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Though I be white-haired, I fare as does a tree<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That blossoms before the fruit is grown;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And a blossom-filled tree is neither dry nor dead.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I feel me nowhere white-haired but on my head;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; My heart and all my limbs are as green<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As laurel through the year is to be seen.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And since you have heard all my intention,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I pray you to my will you will assent."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Diverse men diversely him told<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of marriage many old examples.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Somme blamed it, some praised it, certainly,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But at the last, shortly to say,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As every day altercation occurs<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Between friends in disputation,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There befell a strife betwixt his two brothers,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of whom that one was called Placebo;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Justinus truly was called that other.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Placebo said, "O January, brother,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Full little need had you, my lord so dear,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To ask counsel of any that is here,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Except that you are so full of wisdom<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That it does not please you, for your high prudence,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To deviate from the word of Solomon.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This word said he unto us every one:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; `Do everything according to good advice,' thus said he,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; `And then shalt thou not repent.'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But though Solomon spoke such a word,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; My own dear brother and my lord,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As surely as God my soul may bring to rest,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I hold your own counsel is the best.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For, brother mine, of me take this advice:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I have now been a courtier all my life,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And God it knows, though I am unworthy,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I have stood in very high degree<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Among lords of very high rank;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Yet had I never with any of them disagreement.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I never contradicted them, truly;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I know well that my lord knows more than I.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What he says, I consider it unshakably true;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I say the same, or else something similar.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A full great fool is any counselor<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That serves any lord of high honor,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That dares presume, or else think it,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That his counsel should surpass his lord's judgment.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Nay, lords are no fools, by my faith!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You have yourselves showed here to-day<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Such high good judgment, so piously and well,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That I consent and confirm every bit<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; All your words and your opinion.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; By God, there is no man in all this town,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Nor in Italy, that could have spoken better!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Christ considers himself by this counsel very well pleased.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And truly, it is a bold act<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; By any man that is advanced in age<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To take a young wife; by my father's kin,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Your heart hangs on a jolly pin (is very merry)!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Do now in this matter exactly as you please,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For finally I consider it for the best."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Justinus, that always still sat and listened,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Right in this manner he to Placebo answered:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Now, brother mine, be patient, I pray,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Since you have spoken, and hear what I say.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Seneca, amongst other words wise,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Says that a man ought very carefully consider<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To whom he gives his land or his moveable possessions.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And since I ought to consider very carefully<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To whom I give my goods away from me,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Well much more I ought to consider<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To whom I give my body for always.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I warn you well, it is no child's play<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To take a wife without deliberation.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; One must inquire -- this is my opinion --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Whether she be wise, or sober, or given to drink,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or proud, or else otherwise a shrew,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A scold, or waster of thy goods,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or rich, or poor, or else man-crazy.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Although it is so that no man shall find <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Any in this world that is perfect in everything,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; No man, nor beast, such as men could imagine;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But nevertheless it ought enough suffice<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With any wife, (to learn) if it so were that she had<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; More good personal qualities than her bad vices;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And all this requires leisure to find out.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For, God it knows, I have wept many a tear<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Full privately, since I have had a wife.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Praise whosoever will a wedded man's life,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Certainly I find in it nothing but cost and care<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And duties, of all blisses bare.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And yet, God knows, my neighbors about,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And especially many a crowd of women,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Say that I have the most steadfast wife,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And also the meekest one that bears life;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But I know best where my shoe pinches me.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You may, for me, do just as you like;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Consider -- you are a man of advanced age --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; How that you enter into marriage,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And especially with a young wife and a fair.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; By him that made water, earth, and air,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The youngest man that is in all this company<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Is busy enough to bring it about<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To have his wife alone. Trust me,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You shall not please her fully years three --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This is to say, to do her full pleasure.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A wife requires constant attention.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I pray you that you be not displeased."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Well," said this January, "and hast thou spoken?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Straw for thy Seneca, and for thy proverbs!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I would not give a bread basket full of herbs<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For academic talk. Wiser men than thou,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As thou hast heard, assented right now<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To my purpose. Placebo, what say you?"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "I say it is a cursed man," said he,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "That hinders matrimony, certainly."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And with that word they rise immediately,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And are agreed fully that he should<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Be wedded when he pleased and where he would.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Exaggerated imagination and constant thought<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; From day to day became fixed in the soul <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of January concerning his marriage.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Many a fair shape and many a fair visage<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There passes through his heart night after night,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As if one took a mirror, polished bright,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And set it in a common market-place,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Then should he see full many a figure pace<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; By his mirror; and in the same manner<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Did January within his thought imagine<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; About maidens which dwelt nearby him.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He knew not on which he might settle.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For if that one have beauty in her face,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Another stands so in the people's good opinion<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For her seriousness and her goodness<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That of the people greatest praise has she;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And some were rich and had a bad reputation.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But nevertheless, between earnestness and joking (in every way),<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He at the last decided upon one,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And let all others from his heart go,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And chose her by his own authority;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For love is blind always, and can not see.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And when he was in his bed brought,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He portrayed in his heart and in his thought<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Her fresh beauty and her tender age,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Her small waist, her arms long and slender,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Her wise self-control, her nobility,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Her womanly bearing, and her seriousness.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And when he on her had decided,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He thought his choice could not be bettered.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For when he himself had decided,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He thought each other man's wit so bad<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That it would be impossible to reply<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Against his choice; this was his fantasy.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His friends sent he to, at his request,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And prayed them to do him that pleasure,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That hastily they would come to him;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He would abridge their labor, one and all.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He needs no more to travel about;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He had decided on whom he would settle.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Placebo came, and also his friends quickly,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And first of all he asked them all a favor,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That none of them make any arguments <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Against the purpose which he has taken,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Which purpose was pleasing to God, said he,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And true ground of his prosperity.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He said there was a maiden in the town,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who for beauty had great renown,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Even though she was of low rank;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Her youth and her beauty are enough for him .<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Which maid, he said, he would have as his wife,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To lead in ease and holiness his life;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And thanked God that he might have her entirely,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So that no one shall share his bliss.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And prayed them to labor in this need,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And arrange that he fail not to succeed;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For then, he said, his spirit was at ease.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Then there is," said he, "nothing that can displease me,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Save one thing sticks in my conscience,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Which I will tell in your presence.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "I have," said he, "heard said, full long ago,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There can no man have perfect blisses two --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This is to say, in earth and also in heaven.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For though he keep him from the seven sins,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And also from every branch of that same tree (of sin),<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Yet is there such perfect felicity<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And such great ease and pleasure in marriage<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That ever I am frightened now in my old age<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That I shall lead now so merry a life,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So pleasing, without woe and strife,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That I shall have my heaven here in earth.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For since that true heaven is bought so dear<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With tribulation and great penance,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; How should I then, who live in such pleasure<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As all wedded men do with her wives,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Come to the bliss where Christ eternally lives?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This is my dread, and you, my brethren two,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Resolve this problem, I pray."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Justinus, who hated his folly,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Answered straight away in his mockery;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And because he would his long tale abridge,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He would cite no authority,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But said, "Sir, providing there be no obstacle<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Other than this, God by his high miracle<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And of his mercy may so for you work<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That, before you have your rite of holy church (last sacrament),<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You may repent of the wedded man's life,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In which you say there is no woe nor strife.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And else, God forbid that he should not send<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A wedded man grace to repent himself <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Well more often than a single man!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And therefore, sir -- the best advice I know --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Despair you not, but have in your memory,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Perhaps she may be your purgatory!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She may be God's instrument and God's whip;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Then shall your soul up to heaven skip<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Swifter than does an arrow out of a bow.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I hope to God, hereafter shall you know<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That there is not so great felicity<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In marriage, nor never more shall be,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That shall keep you from your salvation,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Providing that you use, as is proper and reasonable,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The pleasures of your wife moderately,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And that you please her not too amorously,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And that you keep yourself also from other sin.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; My tale is done, for my wit is thin.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Be not afraid of this, my brother dear,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But let us wade out of this matter.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Wife of Bath, if you have understood her,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of marriage, which we have in hand,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Declared has full well in little space.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Now farewell. God have you in his grace."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And with this word this Justin and his brother<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Have taken their leave, and each of them of other.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For when they saw that it must necessarily be,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They worked so, by sly and wise negotiation,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That she, this maiden who May was called,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As hastily as ever that she might<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Shall wedded be unto this January.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I believe it would be too long to delay you,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If I told you of every legal document and bond<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; By which she was endowed with his land,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or to hear of her rich array.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But finally the day is come<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That to the church both are they went<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To receive the holy sacrament (of marriage).<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Forth comes the priest, with stole about his neck,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And commanded her to be like Sarah and Rebecca<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In wisdom and in faithfulness of marriage;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And said his prayers, as is the usage,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And makes the sign of the cross over them, and prayed God should them bless,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And made all secure enough with holiness.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thus are they wedded with solemnity,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And at the feast sits he and she<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With other worthy folk upon the dais.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; All full of joy and bliss is the palace,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And full of instruments and of foods,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The most delicious of all Italy.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Before them stood instruments of such sound<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That Orpheus, nor Amphioun of Thebes,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Made never such a melody.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; At every course then came loud minstrelsy<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That never trumpeted Joab to be heard,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Nor that Theodomas, yet half so clear<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; At Thebes when the city was in danger.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Bacchus pours them the wine all around,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And Venus laughs upon every person,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For January had become her knight<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And would test his spirit both <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In liberty, and also in marriage;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And with her torch in her hand about<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Dances before the bride and all the company.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And certainly, I dare right well say this,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Hymen, that god of wedding is,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Saw never in his life so merry a wedded man.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Hold thou thy peace, thou poet Martianus Capella,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who writes for us that same wedding merry<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of her, Philology, and him, Mercury,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And of the songs that the Muses sang!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Too small is both thy pen, and also thy tongue,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To describe this marriage.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When tender youth has wedded stooping age,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There is such mirth that it can not be written.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Try it yourself; then can you know<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If I lie or not in this matter.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; May, that sits with so benign a manner,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Her to behold it seemed an enchantment.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Queen Esther looked never with such an eye<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; On Ahasuerus, so meek a look has she.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I can not describe to you all her beauty.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But thus much of her beauty tell I can,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That she was like the bright morning of May,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Filled with all beauty and delight.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This January is ravished in a trance<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; At every time he looked on her face;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But in his heart he began to menace her <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That he that night in arms would her strain<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Harder than ever Paris did Helen of Troy.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But nevertheless yet had he great pity<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That that same night he must offend her,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And thought, "Alas! O tender creature,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Now would God you might well endure<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; All my desire, it is so sharp and keen!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I am afraid you shall not be able to endure it.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But God forbid that I did all my might!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Now would God that it were become night,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And that the night would last evermore.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I would that all this people were gone."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And finally he takes all possible pains,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As he best could, so far as good manners allowed, <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To hasten them from the dinner in subtle manner.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The time came that it was reasonable to rise;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And after that men dance and drink deeply,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And spiced cakes all about the house they passed,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And full of joy and bliss is every man --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; All but a squire, called Damian,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who carved before the knight full many a day.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He was so ravished on his lady May<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That for the very pain he was nearly crazy.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Almost he fainted and swooned where he stood,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So sorely has Venus hurt him with her torch,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As she carried it dancing in her hand;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And to his bed he went hastily.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; No more of him at this time speak I,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But there I let him weep enough and complain<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Until fresh May will rue on his pain.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; O perilous fire, that in the bedstraw breeds!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; O enemy in one's household, that offers his service!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; O servant traitor, false domestic servant,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Like to the sly untrue adder in one's bosom,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; God protect us all from your acquaintance!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; O January, drunk with pleasure<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In marriage, see how thy Damian,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thine own squire and thy servant from birth,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Intends to do thee villainy.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; God grant thee thy foe in thy household to espy!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For in this world is no worse pestilence<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Than a foe in thy household always in thy presence.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The sun has completed his daily journey;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; No longer can its body sojourn<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; On the horizon, in that latitude.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Night with its mantle, that is dark and rude,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Did overspread the hemisphere about;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For which departed is this cheerful crowd<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; From January, with thanks on all sides.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Home to their houses cheerfully they ride,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Where they attend to their affairs as they pleased<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And when they see their time, go to rest.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Soon after that, this hasty January<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Would go to bed; he would no longer tarry.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He drinks mulled wine, claret, and strong white wine<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With hot spices to increase his desire;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And many a very fine aphrodisiac has he,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Such as the cursed monk, Dan Constantine,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Has written in his book "Concerning Intercourse";<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To eat them all he was not at all averse.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And to his private friends thus said he:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "For God's love, as soon as it can be done,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Have all this house emptied in courteous manner."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And they have done right as he will command.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Men drink and draw the curtain (dividing the room) straightway.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The bride was brought to bed as still as stone;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And when the bed was by the priest blessed,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Out of the chamber has every one gone,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And January has fast in arms taken<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His fresh May, his paradise, his mate.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He lulls her; he kisses her full often;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With thick bristles of his beard rough,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Like to the skin of a shark, sharp as brier --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For he was all freshly shaved in his fashion --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He rubs her about her tender face,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And said thus, "Alas! I must do injury<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To you, my spouse, and you greatly offend<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Before the time comes that I will down descend.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But nevertheless, consider this," said he,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "There is no workman, whosoever he be,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That can work both well and hastily;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This will be done at leisure perfectly.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It does not matter how long we play;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In true wedlock we two are coupled,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And blessed be the yoke that we are in,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For in our acts we can do no sin.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A man can do no sin with his wife,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Nor hurt himself with his own knife,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For we have leave by the law to enjoy ourselves."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thus labors he until the day dawned;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And then he takes a bit of bread soaked in fine claret,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And upright in his bed then sits he,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And after that he sang full loud and clear,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And kissed his wife, and acted lecherously.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He was frisky as a colt, full of wantonness,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And full of chatter as a spotted magpie.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The slack skin about his neck shakes<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; While he sang, so chants he and croaks.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But God knows what May thought in her heart,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When she saw him sitting up in his shirt,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In his night-cap, and with his lean neck;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She rates his playing not worth a bean.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Then said he thus, "My rest will I take;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Now day is come, I can no longer remain awake."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And down he laid his head and slept until nine.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And afterwards, when he saw his time,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Up rises January; but fresh May<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Held her chamber until the fourth day,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As is the best usage of wives.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For every labor sometime must have rest,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or else long can he not endure;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This is to say, no living creature,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Be it of fish, or bird, or beast, or man.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Now will I speak of woeful Damian,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That languishes for love, as you shall hear;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Therefore I speak to him in this manner:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I say, "O innocent Damian, alas!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Answer to my question, in this case.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; How shalt thou to thy lady, fresh May,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Tell thy woe? She will always say nay.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Also if thou speak, she will thy woe reveal.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; God be thy help! I can no better say."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This sick Damian in Venus' fire<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So burns that he dies for desire,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For which he put his life at risk.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; No longer could he in this way endure,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But secretly a writing set he borrowed,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And in a letter wrote he all his sorrow,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In the manner of a poetic lament or a song,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Unto his fair, fresh lady May;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And in a purse of silk which hung on his shirt<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He has put it, and laid it at his heart.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The moon, that was at noon that same day<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That January has wedded fresh May<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In two degrees of Taurus, was into Cancer glided;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So long has May in her chamber abided,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As custom is unto these nobles all.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A bride shall not eat in the hall<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Until four days, or three days at the least,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Are passed; then let her go to feast.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The fourth day completed from noon to noon,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When the high mass was done,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In hall this January and May sit,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As fresh as is the bright summer's day.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And so befell that this good man<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Remembered this Damian,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And said, "Saint Mary! how can this be,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That Damian does not attend on me?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Is he always sick, or how can this happen?"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His squires, who stood there beside,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Excused him because of his sickness,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Which prevented him from doing his duties;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; No other cause might make him tarry.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "I am sorry about that," said this January,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "He is a gentle squire, by my troth!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If he died, it would be a harm and a pity.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He is as wise, discreet, and as circumspect<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As any man I know of his rank,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And moreover manly, and also willing to serve,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And to be a worthy man right able.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But after dinner, as soon as ever I can,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I will myself visit him, and also May,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To do him all the comfort that I can."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And for that word every man blessed him,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That of his goodness and his graciousness <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He would so comfort in sickness<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His squire, for it was a gentle deed.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "My Lady," said this January, "take good heed,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; At after-dinner you with all your women,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When you have been in chamber out of this hall,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That all you go see this Damian.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Cheer him up -- he is a gentle man;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And tell him that I will him visit,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When I have done nothing but rested myself a little;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And hurry yourself, for I will wait<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Until you sleep fast by my side."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And with that word he began to him to call<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A squire, that was master of ceremonies of his hall,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And told him certain things, what he wanted.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This fresh May has held straight her way<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With all her women unto Damian.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Down by his bed's side sits she then,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Comforting him as graciously as she can.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This Damian, when he saw his opportunity,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In a secret way his purse and also his letter,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In which he had written his desire,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Has put into her hand, without (doing) more,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Save that he sighs wonderfully deep and sore,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And softly to her right thus said he:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Mercy! And (I ask) that you not discover me,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For I am dead if this thing be known."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This purse has she within her bosom hidden<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And went her way; you get no more from me.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But unto January come is she,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who on his bed's side sits full softly.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He takes her, and kisses her full often,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And laid him down to sleep, and that straightway.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She pretended that she must go<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Where you know that every person must go by necessity;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And when she of this letter has taken heed,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She tore it all to pieces at the last,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And in the privy softly threw it.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who is perplexed now but fair fresh May?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Down by old January she lay,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who slept until the cough has him awaked.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Straightway he prayed her to strip herself all naked;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He would of her, he said, have some pleasure;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He said her clothes got in his way,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And she obeys, whether she wants to or not.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But lest that prudish folk be with me wroth,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; How he worked, I dare not tell to you,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or whether she thought it paradise or hell.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But here I let them work in their way<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Until bell for evening prayers rang and they had to arise.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Were it by destiny or by chance,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Were it by astronomical influence or by nature,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or configuration of the stars, that in such a state<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The heaven stood that time that it fortunate<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Was to present a petition concerning Venus' works --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For every thing has time, as say these clerks --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To any woman to get her love,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I can not say; but great God above,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That knows that no act is without cause,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; May he judge of all, for I will hold my peace.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But truth is this, how this fresh May<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Has taken such impression that day<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of pity for this sick Damian<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That from her heart she can not drive<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The thought to comfort him.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Certainly," thought she, "whomever this thing may displease<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I care not, for here I him assure<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To love him best of any creature,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Though he had no more than his shirt."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Lo, pity runs soon in gentle heart!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Here can you see what excellent generosity<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In women is, when they carefully deliberate a matter.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Some tyrant is, as there be many a one<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who has a heart as hard as any stone,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who would have let him die in the place<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Well rather than have granted him her grace,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And rejoice in her cruel pride,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And care not to be a homicide.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This gentle May, filled full of pity,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In her own hand a letter made she,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In which she grants him her true grace.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There lacks nothing but only day and place<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Where she might satisfy his desires,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For it shall be right as he will devise.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And when she saw her time, upon one day<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To visit this Damian goes May,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And craftily this letter down she thrust<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Under his pillow; let him read it if he wishes.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She takes him by the hand and hard him squeezes<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So secretly that no one knew of it,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And bade him be all healthy, and forth she went<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To January, when he for her sent.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Up rises Damian the next morning;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; All passed was his sickness and his sorrow.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He combs himself, he preens and neatens himself,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He does all that his lady desires and pleases,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And also to January he goes as humbly<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As ever did a dog trained to hunt with an archer.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He is so pleasant unto every man<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (For craft is all, whoever can do it)<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That every one is eager to speak good of him,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And fully in his lady's favor he stood.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thus leave I Damian going about his business,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And in my tale forth I will proceed.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Some clerks maintain that felicity<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Consists of delight, and therefore certainly he,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This noble January, with all his might,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In a respectable manner, as is suitable to a knight,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Arranged for himself to live full voluptuously.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His lodging, his clothing, as suitably<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To his degree was made as is a king's.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Amongst others of his suitable things,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He made a garden, walled all with stone;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So fair a garden know I anywhere none.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For, beyond doubt, I truly suppose<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That he who wrote the Romance of the Rose<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Could not the beauty of it well describe;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Nor Priapus could not be adequate,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Though he be god of gardens, to tell<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The beauty of the garden and the well<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That stood under a laurel always green.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Very often he, Pluto, and his queen,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Proserpine, and all their fairies,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Amused themselves and made melody<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; About that well, and danced, as men told.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This noble knight, this January the old,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Such pleasure has in it to walk and play,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That he will no one allow to bear the key<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Save he himself; for of the small gate<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He bore always of silver a latchkey,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With which, when he desired, he unlocked it.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And when he would pay his wife her marital debt<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In summer season, thither would he go,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And May his wife, and no one but those two;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And things which that were not done abed,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He in the garden performed and accomplished them.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And in this way, many a merry day,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Lived this January and fresh May.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But worldly joy can not always endure<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To January, nor to any creature.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; O sudden chance! O thou Fortune unstable!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Similar to the scorpion so deceitful,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That flatter with thy head when thou wilt sting;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thy tail is death, through thy poisoning.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; O brittle joy! O sweet venom deceitful!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; O monster, that so subtly can disguise<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thy gifts under appearance of steadfastness,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That thou deceivest both high and low (everyone)!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Why hast thou January thus deceived,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thou who had received him for thy closest friend ?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And now thou hast deprived him of both his eyes,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For sorrow of which he desires to die.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Alas, this noble generous January,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Amid his pleasure and his prosperity,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Is grown blind, and that all suddenly.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He weeps and he wails pitifully;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And with all this the fire of jealousy,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Lest that his wife should fall in some folly,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So burned his heart that he sincerely wished <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That some man both her and him had slain.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For neither after his death nor in his life<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Would he that she were neither lover nor wife,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But ever live as widow in clothes black,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Solitary as the turtledove that lost has her mate.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But at the last, after a month or two,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His sorrow abated, truth to say;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For when he knew it can not be otherwise,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He patiently accepted his adversity,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Except that, no doubt, he can not refrain<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; From being more jealous all the time;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Which jealousy was so excessive<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That neither in hall, nor in any other house,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Nor in any other place, no longer,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He would suffer her to ride or walk,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Unless he had a hand always on her;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For which full often weeps fresh May,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who loves Damian so graciously<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That she must either die suddenly<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or else she must have him as she wishes.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She expects that her heart would burst.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Upon that other side Damian<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Is become the most sorrowful man<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That ever was, for neither night nor day<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Could he speak one word to fresh May,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Regarding his purpose, of any such matter,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Without January's hearing it,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who had a hand upon her always.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But nevertheless, by writing to and fro<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And secret signs he knew what she meant,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And she knew also the aim of his plan.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; O January, what might it thee avail,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Though thou could see as far as ships sail?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For it is as good to be deceived when blind<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As to be deceived when a man can see.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Lo, Argus, who had a hundred eyes,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For all that ever he could peer or pry,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Yet was he deceived, and, God knows, so are others<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That confidently suppose indeed that it is not so.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To overlook (trouble) is an advantage, I say no more.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This fresh May, whom I spoke of formerly,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In warm wax has made an impression of the latchkey <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That January carried of the small gate,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; By which into his garden often he went;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And Damian, who knew all her plan,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The latchkey counterfeited secretly.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There is no more to say, but hastily<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Some wonder by this latchkey shall betide,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Which you shall hear, if you will abide.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; O noble Ovid, full truth sayest thou, God knows,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What trick is it, though (finding) it be long and painful,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That Love will not find it out in some manner?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; By Pyramus and Thisbe can one learn;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Though they were kept full long strictly in every way,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They are agreed, whispering through a wall,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Where no one could have found such a trick.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But now to purpose: before eight days <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Were passed [of] the month of [June], it happened<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That January has caught so great a desire,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Through incitement of his wife, to enjoy himself<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In his garden, and no one (there) but those two,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That in a morning unto his May says he:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Rise up, my wife, my love, my noble lady!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The turtle dove's voice is heard, my dove sweet;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The winter is gone with all his rains wet.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Come forth now, with thy dove-like eyes!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; How fairer are thy breasts than is wine!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The garden is enclosed all about;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Come forth, my white spouse! Beyond doubt<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thou hast me wounded in my heart, O wife!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; No blemish on thee knew I all my life.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Come forth, and let us take our pleasure;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I chose thee for my wife and my comfort."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Such old ignorant words used he.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To Damian a sign made she,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That he should go before with his latchkey.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This Damian then has opened the gate,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And in he hurried, and that in such a way<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That no one could either see or hear it,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And quickly he sits still under a bush.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This January, as blind as is a stone,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With May in his hand, and no one else,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Into his fresh garden has gone,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And closed the gate quickly.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Now wife," said he, "here is no one but thou and I,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That art the creature that I best love.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For by that Lord that sits in heaven above,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I had rather die on a knife<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Than thee offend, true dear wife!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For God's sake, think how I thee chose,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Not for any greed, doubtless,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But only for the love I had to thee.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And although I be old and can not see,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Be to me true, and I will tell you why.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Three things, certainly, shall you win thereby:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; First, love of Christ, and to yourself honor,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And all my heritage, town and tower;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I give it to you, draw up deeds as you please;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This shall be done to-morrow before sun goes to rest,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As God my soul may bring in bliss.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I pray you first, to seal the contract, you kiss me;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And though that I be jealous, blame me not.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You are so deeply imprinted in my thought<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That, when I consider your beauty<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And in addition to that the unsuitable old age of me,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I can not, certainly, though I should die,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Bear to be out of your company<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For true love; this is without doubt.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Now kiss me, wife, and let us roam about."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This fresh May, when she these words heard,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Graciously to January answered,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But first of all she began to weep.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "I have," said she, "a soul to keep<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As well as you, and also my honor,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And of my wifehood that same tender flower,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Which I have entrusted in your hand,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When the priest to you my body bound;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Wherefore I will answer in this manner,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; By the leave of you, my lord so dear:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I pray to God that never dawn the day<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That I do not die, as foully as woman can,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If ever I do unto my kin that shame,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or else I damage so my name,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That I be false; and if I commit that offense,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Have me stripped and put me in a sack,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And in the next river have me drowned.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I am a gentle woman and no wench.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Why speak you thus? But men are always untrue,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And women have reproof of you always.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You have no other manner of behavior, I believe,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Except to speak to us of distrust and reproof."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And with that word she saw where Damian<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Sat in the bush, and she began to cough,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And with her finger signs made she<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That Damian should climb upon a tree<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That loaded was with fruit, and up he went.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For truly he knew all her plan,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And every sign that she could make,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Well better than January, her own mate,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For in a letter she had told him all<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of this matter, what he must do.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And thus I let him sit upon the pear tree,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And January and May roaming merrily.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Bright was the day, and blue the firmament;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Phoebus has his streams of gold down sent<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To gladden every flower with his warmness.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He was that time in Gemini, as I guess,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But little from his declination<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of Cancer, Jove's exaltation.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And it so befell, that bright morning-tide<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That in that garden, in the further side,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Pluto, that is king of Fairyland,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And many a lady in his company,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Following his wife, the queen Proserpine,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Whom he kidnapped out of Etna<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; While she gathered flowers in the mead --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In Claudian you can read the stories,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; How in his grisly chariot he fetched her --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This king of Fairyland then set himself down<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Upon a bench made of pieces of turf, fresh and green,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And right away thus said he to his queen:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "My wife," said he, "there can no one say nay;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The experience so proves every day<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The treasons which women do to man.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Ten hundred thousand [tales] I can tell<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (That are) famous concerning your faithlessness and frailty.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; O Solomon, wise, and richest of wealth,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Filled with wisdom and with worldly glory,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Full worthy are thy words to (keep in) memory<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To every one that wit and reason knows.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thus praises he yet the goodness of man:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; `Amongst a thousand men yet found I one,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But of all women found I none.'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Thus says the king that knows your wickedness.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And Jesus, son of Sirak, as I suppose,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Speaks reverence of you but seldom.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A wild fir and corrupt pestilence<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Fall upon your bodies yet to-night!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; See you not this honorable knight,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Because, alas, that he is blind and old,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His own man shall make him cuckold.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Lo, where he sits, the lecher, in the tree!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Now will I grant, of my majesty,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Unto this old, blind, worthy knight<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That he shall have again his eyes' sight,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When his wife would do him villainy.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Then shall he know all her harlotry,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In reproof of both her and many others."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "You shall?" said Proserpine, "will you so?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Now by my mother's father's soul I swear<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That I shall give her sufficient answer,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And all women afterwards, for her sake,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That, though they be in any guilt taken,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With bold face they shall themselves excuse,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And bear them down who would them accuse.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For lack of answer none of them shall die.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Although a man had seen a thing with both his eyes,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Yet shall we women face it out boldly,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And weep, and swear, and chide deceitfully,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So that you men shall be as ignorant as geese.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "What do I care for your authorities?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I know well that this Jew, this Solomon,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Found of us women many a fool.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But though he found no good woman,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Yet many another man has there found <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Women full true, full good, and virtuous.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Witness on them that dwell in Christ's house (heaven);<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With martyrdom they proved their constancy.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Roman histories also remind us<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of many a genuine, true wife also.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But, sir, be not angry, even though it be so,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Though he said he found no good woman,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I pray you take the meaning of the man;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He meant thus, that in perfect goodness<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There is no one but God, neither man nor woman.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Ah! by him who is the only true God,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Why make you so much of Solomon?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Why though he made a temple, God's house?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Why though he was rich and glorious?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So made he also a temple of false gods.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; How might he do a thing that more forbidden is?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; By God, however approvingly you gloss over his name,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He was a lecher and an idolater,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And in his old age he true God forsook;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And if God had not, as says the book,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Spared him for his father's sake, he should<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Have lost his reign sooner than he would have wanted.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I reckon all the villainy<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That you of women write not worth a butterfly!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I am a woman, I must necessarily speak,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or else swell until my heart breaks.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For since he said that we are chatterers,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As ever whole I may enjoy my hair (remain alive),<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I shall not cease, for any courtesy,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To speak harm of him that would do us dishonor."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "My Lady," said this Pluto, "be no longer angry;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I give it up! But since I swore my oath<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That I would grant him his sight again,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; My word shall stand, I warn you certainly.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I am a king; it is not proper for me to lie."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "And I," said she, "a queen of Fairy!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Her answer shall she have, I declare.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Let us have no more words concerning this;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For truly, I will no longer contradict you."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Now let us turn again to January,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That in the garden with his fair May<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Sings full merrier than the parrot,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "You love I best, and shall, and none other."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So long about the garden paths is he gone,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Until he was come in front of that same pear tree<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Where this Damian sits full merry<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; On high among the fresh leaves green.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This fresh May, who is so bright and sheen,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Began to sigh, and said, "Alas, my side!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Now sire," said she, "for whatever may happen,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I must have some of the pears that I see,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or I must die, so sore I long<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To eat some of the small green pears.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Help, for her love that is of heaven queen!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I tell you well, a woman in my condition<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; May have for fruit so great an appetite<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That she may die but she have some of it."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Alas," said he, "that I do not have here a servant boy<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That could climb! Alas, alas," said he,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "For I am blind!" "Yea, sir, no matter," said she;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "But would you grant, for God's sake,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The pear tree within your arms to take,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For well I know that you mistrust me,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Then should I climb well enough," said she,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "If I my foot might set upon your back."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Certainly," said he, "there shall be no lack,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (Even if) I might you help with my heart's blood."	<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He stoops down, and on his back she stood,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And caught her by a branch, and up she goes --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I can not use circumlocutions, I am an unlearned man --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And suddenly at once this Damian<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Pulled up the smock, and in he thrust.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And when Pluto saw this great wrong,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To January he gave again his sight,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And made him see as well as he ever could.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And when he had recovered his sight again,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There was never man of anything so happy,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But on his wife his thought was evermore.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Up to the tree he cast his eyes two,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And saw that Damian had treated his wife <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In such a manner it can not be expressed,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Unless I would speak crudely;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And up he gave a roaring and a cry,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As does the mother when the child shall die:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Out! Help! Alas! Help!" he began to cry,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "O brazen crude lady, what dost thou?"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And she answered, "Sir, what ails you?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Have patience and reason in your mind.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I have helped you with both your eyes blind.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Upon peril of my soul, I shall not lie,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As I was taught, to heal with your eyes,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Was no thing better, to make you to see,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Than to struggle with a man upon a tree.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; God knows, I did it in full good intent."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Struggle?" said he, "Yea, indeed in it went!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; God give you both a shameful death to die!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He screwed thee; I saw it with my eyes,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And else may I be hanged by the neck!"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Then is," said she, "my medicine false;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For certainly, if you could see,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You would not say these words unto me.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You have some glimpse, and no perfect sight."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "I see," said he, "as well as ever I could,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thanked be God! With both my eyes two,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And by my troth, it seemed to me he did thee so."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "You are dazed, dazed, good sir," said she;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "This thanks have I because I have made you see.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Alas," said she, "that ever I was so kind!"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Now, lady," said he, "let all pass out of mind.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Come down, my dear, and if I have misspoken,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So God help me, I am very sorry.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But, by my father's soul, I thought to have seen<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; How this Damian had by thee laid,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And thy smock had lain upon his breast."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Yea, sir," said she, "you may think as you please.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But, sir, a man that wakes out of his sleep,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He can not suddenly well take heed<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of a thing, nor see it perfectly,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Until he be fully awakened.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Right so a man that long has blind been,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Can not suddenly so well see,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; First when his sight is newly come again,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As he that has a day or two been able to see.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Until your sight be settled a while<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There may full many a sight deceive you.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Beware, I pray you, for by heaven's king,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Full many a man supposes to see a thing,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And it is entirely different than it seems.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He that misunderstands, he misjudges."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And with that word she leaped down from the tree.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This January, who is glad but he?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He kisses her and embraces her full often,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And on her womb he strokes her full softly,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And to his palace he has her led home.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Now, good men, I pray you to be glad.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thus ends here my tale of January;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; God bless us, and his mother Saint Mary!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Ah! God's mercy!" said our Host then,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Now such a wife I pray God keep me from!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Lo, what tricks and craftiness<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Are in women! For always as busy as bees<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Are they, us innocent men to deceive,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And from the truth ever will they deviate;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; By this Merchant's tale it is well proven.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But doubtless, as true as any steel<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I have a wife, though that she poor be,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But of her tongue, a blabbing shrew is she,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And yet she has a heap of other vices;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thereof no matter! Let all such things go by.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But know you what? In secret be it said,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I sorely rue that I am unto her tied.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For if I should reckon every vice<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Which she has, indeed I would be too foolish.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And the cause why? It should reported be<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And told to her by some of this company --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; By whom, it needs not to declare,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Since women know how to display such wares;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And also my wit suffices not concerning this<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To tell all; therefore my tale is done."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My dear love," she said, "Oh my Don John,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish I could hide this secret,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it must come out; I can delay no longer,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My husband is to me the worst man<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That ever was since the world began.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But since I am a wife, it does not suit me<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To tell any one of our private matters,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Neither in bed nor in any other place;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God forbid I should tell it, for His grace!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A wife should say nothing of her husband<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Except what is to his honor, so far as I can understand;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Except unto you this much I shall tell:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So help me God, he is not worth at all<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any way the value of a fly.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But yet his miserliness grieves me most.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And well you know that women naturally<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Desire six things as well as I:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They would that their husbands should be<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vigorous and wise, and rich, and moreover generous,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And obedient unto his wife and vigorous in bed.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But by that same Lord that for us bled,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To clothe myself in a manner that does honor to my husband,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On next Sunday I must of necessity pay<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A hundred franks, or else I am lost.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet I would rather that I were never born<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than a disgrace or dishonor were done to me;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And also if my husband might discover it,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would be as good as lost; and therefore I pray you,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lend me this sum, or else I must die.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don John, I say, lend me these hundred franks.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By God, I will not fail to give you my thanks,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it pleases you to do what I pray of you.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For at a certain day I will pay you,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And do to you whatever pleasure and service<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That I can do, exactly as you please to command.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And unless I do so, God take on me vengeance<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As foul as ever had Ganelon of France."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This gentle monk answered in this manner:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Now truly, my own dear lady,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have," he said, "on you such great pity<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That I swear to you, and pledge you my word,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That when your husband is gone to Flanders,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will deliver you out of this care;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For I will bring you a hundred franks."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And with that word he caught her by the flanks,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And embraces her hard, and kissed her often.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go now your way," he said, "all still and quietly,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And let us dine as soon as you can;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For by my sundial it is almost noon.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Go now, and be as true as I shall be."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Now God forbid (anything) else, sir," she said;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And forth she goes as jolly as a magpie,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And ordered the cooks that they should hasten,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So that people could dine, and that quickly.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Up to her husband this wife is gone,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And boldly knocks at his counting-house door.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who is there?" he said. "By Saint Peter! it's me,"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Said she; "What, sir! how long will you fast?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How long a time will you reckon and calculate<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your sums, and your books, and your business matters?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The devil take all such reckonings!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You have enough, by God, of God's gifts;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Come down to-day, and let your moneybags be.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are you not ashamed that Don John<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Must go fasting all this day long?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What! let us hear a mass and go dine."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wife," this man said, "little canst thou guess<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The worrisome preoccupations that we have.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For of us merchants, as God may save me,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And by that lord that is called Saint Yve,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scarcely amongst twelve shall two thrive<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Continually, surviving unto our age.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We may well seem cheerful and put on a good face,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And endure the world as it may be,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And keep our condition private, <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until we are dead, or else we go on<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A pilgrimage, or go out of the way (in hiding).<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And therefore I have great need<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To plan carefully upon this tricky world,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For always we must stand in fear<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of chance and fortune in our business dealings.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will go to Flanders tomorrow at daylight,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And come back again, as soon as ever I can.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For which, my dear wife, I beseech thee,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be to every creature humble and meek,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And be diligent to guard our possessions,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And properly govern our house well.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou hast enough, in every sort of way,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That may suffice to a prosperous household.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You lack no supplies nor victuals;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou shalt not lack silver in thy purse ."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And with that word he shut his counting house-door,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And down he goes, no longer would he delay.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But hastily a mass was there said,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And speedily the tables were laid,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And quickly they sped to the dinner,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And richly the merchant fed this monk.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At after-dinner Don John soberly<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Took aside this merchant, and privately<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said to him thus: "Cousin, it stands so,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That I see well to Bruges you will go.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God and Saint Augustine speed and guide you!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I pray you, cousin, that you ride carefully.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Govern yourself also in your diet<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moderately, and especially in this heat.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between us two there need be no elaborate courtesies;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Farewell, cousin; God protect you from trouble!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And if there be any thing by day or night,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it lie in my power and my might,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That you will ask of me in any way,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It shall be done exactly as you will specify.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"One thing, before you go, if it may be,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would pray of you: to lend me<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A hundred franks, for a week or two,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a certain number of beasts that I must buy,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With which to stock a place that is ours.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So help me God, I would it were yours!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I surely shall not fail to repay you on the day it is due,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not for a thousand franks, by so much as twenty minutes.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But let this thing be secret, I pray you,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For yet to-night I must buy these beasts.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now fare well, my own dear cousin;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many thanks for your expenditures and for your hospitality."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This noble merchant courteously straightway<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Answered and said, "Oh my cousin, Don John,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now surely this is a small request.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My gold is yours, whenever it pleases you,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And not only my gold, but my merchandise.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take what you please; God forbid that you stint.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But there is one thing, you know it well enough<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About merchants, that their money is their plough.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We may borrow while we have a good name,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But to be without gold, it is no joke.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pay it back when it is convenient for you;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to my power, I would be very glad to please you."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These hundred franks he fetched forth quickly,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And privately he gave them to Don John.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No creature in all this world knew of this loan<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Except for this merchant and Don John alone.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They drink, and speak, and stroll about a while and amuse themselves,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until Don John rides to his abbey.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The morning came, and forth this merchant rides<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To Flanders; his apprentice guides him well<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until he came merrily into Bruges.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now goes this merchant quickly and busily<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About his business, and buys and obtains credit.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He neither plays at the dice nor dances,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But as a merchant (should), shortly to tell,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He led his life, and there I let him dwell.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Sunday next after the merchant was gone,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To Seint-Denis is come Don John,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the top of his head and beard all fresh and newly shaved.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In all the house there was not so humble a servant boy,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor any one else, who was not very glad<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That my lord Don John was come again.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And shortly, to go directly to the point,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This fair wife agreed with Don John<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That for these hundred franks he should all night<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have her in his arms flat on her back;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And this agreement was performed in deed.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In mirth all night they lead a busy life<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until it was day, and Don John went his way,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And bade the household "Farewell, have good day!"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For none of them, nor any one in the town,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has of Don John any suspicion at all.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And forth he rides home to his abbey,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or where he pleases; I say no more of him.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This merchant, when the fair was ended,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did return to Seint-Denis,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And with his wife he makes merriment and good cheer,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And tells her that merchandise is so expensive<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That of necessity he had to make an arrangement for credit<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For he was bound in a formal pledge<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To pay twenty thousand shields quickly.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For which this merchant is gone to Paris<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To borrow from certain friends that he had<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A certain number of franks; and some with him he brought.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when he had come into the town,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For great fondness and great affection,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He first goes unto Don John to visit him;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not to ask or borrow money from him,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in order to know and see about his welfare,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And to tell him of his business,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As friends do when they are met together.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don John makes him festive and merry hospitality,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he told him in turn, in great detail,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How he had bought well and successfully,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanked be God, all of his merchandise,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Except that he must, no matter what, <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arrange for a loan, as for his best (course of action),<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then he would be in joy and rest.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don John answered, "Certainly, I am glad<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That you are come home again in good health.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And if I were rich, as I may have bliss,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You should not lack twenty thousand shields ,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For you so kindly this other day<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lent me gold; and as I know how and can,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thank you, by God and by Saint James!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But nonetheless, I gave unto our dame,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your wife, at home, the same gold in return<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon your counting board; she knows it well, certainly,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By certain proofs that I can tell her.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, by your leave, I can no longer dwell;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our abbot will go out of this town very soon,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I must go in his company.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Greet well our dame, my own sweet niece,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And farewell, dear cousin, until we meet!"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This merchant, who was very prudent and wise,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has obtained credit, and paid also in Paris<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To certain Lombard bankers, ready in their hand (in cash),<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of gold, and redeemed his bond from them;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And home he goes, merry as a parrot,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For well he knew he stood in such condition<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That by necessity he must earn in that journey<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A thousand franks above all his costs.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His wife very readily met him at the gate,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As was her long established custom at all times,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all that night they devoted themselves to mirth.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For he was rich and clearly out of debt.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it was day, this merchant did embrace<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His wife anew, and kissed her on her face,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And up he goes and makes it full tough.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No more," said she, "by God, you have enough!"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And wantonly again she played with him<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until at the last thus this merchant said:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"By God," said he, "I am a little angry<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With you, my wife, although I am reluctant to be so.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And do you know why? By God, because I guess<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That you have made a sort of estrangement<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between me and my cousin Don John.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You should have warned me, before I had gone,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That he had paid a hundred franks to you<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In cash; and considered himself ill used,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because I spoke to him about borrowing;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seemed so, by his countenance.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But nonetheless, by God, our heavenly king,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thought not to ask any thing of him.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I pray thee, wife, do so no more;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tell me always, before I go from thee,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If any debtor has in my absence<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paid thee, lest through thy negligence<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I might ask of him a thing that he has paid."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This wife was not afeared nor afraid,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But boldly she said, and that immediately,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"By Mary, I defy the false monk, Don John!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I care not a bit for his proofs;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He gave me a specific amount of gold, that I know well --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What! Evil luck on his monk's snout!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For, God knows it, I thought, without doubt,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That he had given it to me because of you<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To do (something) with it for my honor and my benefit,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of kinship, and also for the good cheer<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That he has had very many times here.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But since I see I stand in this difficulty,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will answer you shortly to the point.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You have more slow-paying debtors than I am!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For I will pay you well and readily<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From day to day, and if it so be that I fail,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am your wife; score it upon my tally (tail),<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I shall pay as soon as ever I can.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For by my troth, I have on my clothing,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And not on waste, spent every bit;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And because I have spent it so well<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For your honor, for God's sake, I say,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not be angry, but let us laugh and play.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You shall have my pretty body as a pledge;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By God, I will not pay you except in bed!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forgive me, my own dear spouse;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turn hitherward, and cheer up."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This merchant saw there was no remedy,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And to chide would be nothing but folly,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the thing can not be amended.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Now wife," he said, "and I forgive thee;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, by thy life, be no longer so generous.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take better care of thy goods, this I give thee as a command."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus ends my tale, and God send us <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tallying (Tailing) enough unto our lives' end. Amen<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Well said, by the body of our Lord," said our Host,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Now long may thou sail by the coast,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Sir gentle master, gentle mariner!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; God give the monk a thousand cartloads of bad years!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A ha! Fellows, beware of such a trick!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The monk made a monkey of the man,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And of his wife as well, by Saint Augustine!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Invite no more monks into your dwelling.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "But now pass over that, and let us look around to see<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who shall now, first of all this company, tell <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Another tale;" and with that word he said,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As courteously as if he had been a maiden,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "My Lady Prioress, by your leave,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If I knew I should not grieve you,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I would judge that you should tell <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A tale next, if it so were that you would.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Now will you grant this, my lady dear?"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Gladly," said she, and said as you shall hear.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Our Host saw well that the bright sun<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The arc of his twelve-hour day has run<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;One fourth, and half an hour and more,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And though he was not far advanced in learning,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He knew it was the eighteenth day<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Of April, that is messenger to May;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And saw well that the shadow of every tree<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Was in length the same quantity<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As was the erect body that caused it.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And therefore by the shadow he judged<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That Phoebus, which shone so clear and bright,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Five and forty degrees had climbed on height,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And for that day, in that latitude,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It was ten o'clock, he did conclude,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And suddenly he pulled his horse about.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Gentlemen," said he, "I warn you, all this company,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;One fourth of this day is gone.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Now for the love of God and of Saint John,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Lose no time, insofar as you can.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Gentlemen, the time wastes away night and day,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And steals from us, in part imperceptibly when sleeping,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And in part through negligence when we are awake,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As does the stream that never turns back,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Descending from the mountain into the plain.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Well can Seneca and many a philosopher<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Bewail time more than gold in coffer;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For `Loss of property may be recovered,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But loss of time ruins us,' said he.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It will not come again, without doubt,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;No more than will Malkin's maidenhead,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When she has lost it in her wantonness.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Let us not grow moldy thus in idleness.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Sir Man of Law," said he, "as you may have bliss,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Tell us a tale now, as was agreed.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;You have submitted, through your free assent,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To stand in this case at my judgment.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Now fulfill your promise;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Then have you done your duty at the least."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Host," said he, "in God's name, I assent;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To break our agreement is not my intent.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Promise is debt, and I will eagerly keep<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;All my promise, I can say no better.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For such law as a man gives another person,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He should himself use it, by right;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Thus our text will have it. But nonetheless, certainly,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Right now I can tell no suitable tale<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That Chaucer, though he is ignorant<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Of meters and of riming craftily,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Has (not already) said them in such English as he knows <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Long ago, as knows many a man;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And if he has not said them, dear brother,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In one book, he has said them in another.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For he has told of lovers up and down<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;More than Ovid made mention of <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In his Epistles, that are very old.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Why should I tell them, since they have been told?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"In youth he wrote about Ceyx and Alcion,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And since has he spoken of each one,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;These noble wives and these lovers also.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Whoever will seek his large volume,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Called the Saints' Legend of Cupid,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There may he see the large wounds wide<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Of Lucretia, and Thisbe of Babylon;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The sword of Dido (used) because of the false Aeneas;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The tree of Phyllis for her Demophon;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The complaint of Deianire and of Hermione,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Of Ariadne, and of Hypsipyle  --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The barren isle standing in the sea --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The drowned Leander for his Hero;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The tears of Helen, and also the woe<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Of Briseis, and of thee, Laodamia;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The cruelty of thee, queen Medea,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Thy little children hanging by the neck,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Because of thy Jason, that was in love so false!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;O Hypermnestra, Penelope, Alcestis,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Your wifehood he commends with the best!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"But certainly no word writes he<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Of that wicked example of Canace,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Who loved her own brother sinfully --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Of such cursed stories I say fie! --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Or else of Apollonius of Tyre,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;How that the cursed king Antiochus<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Deprived his daughter of her maidenhead,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That is so horrible a tale to read,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When he threw her upon the pavement.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And therefore he, after careful consideration<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Would never write in any of his compositions<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Of such unnatural abominations,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nor will I tell any such, if that I may.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"But of my tale what shall I do this day?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I would hate to be likened, doubtless,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To the Muses that men call Pierides --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Metamorphoses shows what I mean;	<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But nonetheless, I reckon it not worth a bean<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Though I come after him with a humble dish.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I speak in prose, and let him make rhymes."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And with that word he, with a solemn demeanor,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Began his tale, as you shall after hear.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;O hateful harm, condition of poverty!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;By thirst, by cold, by hunger so distressed!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To ask help thou art ashamed in thy heart;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;If thou ask for none, thou art so wounded by need <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That true need reveals all thy hidden wound!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Despite all you can do, thou must for indigence<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Either steal, or beg, or borrow thy living expenses!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Thou blamest Christ and sayest full bitterly<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He wrongly allots temporal riches;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Thy neighbor thou blamest sinfully,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And sayest thou hast too little and he has all.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"By my faith," sayest thou, "sometimes he shall pay for it,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When his tail shall burn in the live coals,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For he helps not the needy in their need."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Listen to what is the opinion of the wise:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Better it is to die than to have poverty";<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Thy very neighbor will despise thee."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;If thou be poor, farewell thy reverence!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Yet of the wise man take this advice:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"All the days of poor men are painful."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Beware, therefore, before thou come to that point!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;If thou be poor, thy brother hates thee,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And all thy friends flee from thee, alas!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;O rich merchants, full of prosperity are you,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;O noble, o prudent folk, in such a case as this!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Your bags are not filled with double aces (a losing throw in dice),<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But with six five, that is your winning number;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;At Christmas merrily may you dance!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;You seek land and sea for your winnings;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As wise folk you know all the condition<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Of (foreign) lands; you are fathers of tidings<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And tales, both of peace and of war.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I would right now be without any tales,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Were it not that a merchant, gone by is many a year,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Taught me a tale, which you shall hear.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In Syria once dwelt a company<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Of rich merchants, and moreover trustworthy and true,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That wherever they sent their oriental goods,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Cloth of gold, and satins rich in color.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Their merchandise was so serviceable and so novel<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That every person has desire to trade<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With them, and also to sell them their goods.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Now it happened that the masters of that company<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Have prepared themselves to travel to Rome;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Were it for business or for pleasure,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;No other messenger would they thither send,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But came themselves to Rome; this is the sum of it.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And in such a place as they thought advantageous<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For their purposes, they take their lodging.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;These merchants have sojourned in that town<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A certain length of time, as accorded with their desires.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And it so happened that the excellent renown<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Of the Emperor's daughter, Lady Custance,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Was reported, in full detail,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Unto these Syrian merchants in such a manner,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;From day to day, as I shall tell you.	<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This was the common opinion of every man:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Our Emperor of Rome -- may God look after him! --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A daughter has that, since the world began,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To consider as well her goodness as beauty,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There was never such another as is she.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I pray to God to sustain her in honor,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And would she were of all Europe the queen.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"In her is great beauty, without pride,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Youth, without immaturity or folly;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In all her deeds virtue is her guide;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Humility has slain in her all tyranny.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She is mirror of all courtesy;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Her heart is a true chamber of holiness,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Her hand, minister of generosity in giving alms."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And all this opinion was true, as God is true.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But now to the point let us turn again.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;These merchants have had their ships newly loaded,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And when they have this blissful maiden seen,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Home to Syria they have gone very happily,	<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And they conduct their business as they have done for years,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And live in prosperity; I can tell you no more.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Now it happened that these merchants stood in the good graces<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Of him that was the Sultan of Syria;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For when they came from any foreign place,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He would, of his gracious courtesy,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Entertain them well, and busily seek out<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;News from various countries, to learn<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The wonders that they could have seen or heard.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Amongst other things, specially,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;These merchants have told him of Lady Custance <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Such great noble qualities in earnest, in detail,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That this Sultan has caught such great desire<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To have her figure in his remembrance,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That all his desire and all his intense concern<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Was to love her while his life may endure.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Perhaps in that large book<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Which men call the heaven was written <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In stars, when he was born,	<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That he because of love should have his death, alas!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For in the stars, clearer than is glass,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Is written, God knows, whoever could read it,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The death of every man, without doubt.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In stars, many a winter before then,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Was written the death of Hector, Achilles,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Of Pompey, Julius, before they were born;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The strife of Thebes; and of Hercules,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Of Sampson, Turnus, and of Socrates<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The death; but men's wits are so dull<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That no person can well interpret it fully.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This Sultan for his privy council sent,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And, to pass briefly over this matter,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He has to them declared his intent,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And said to them, certainly, unless he could have the good fortune<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To have Custance within a little time,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He was as good as dead; and ordered them hastily<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To arrange some remedy to save his life .<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Different men said different things;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;They argue, consider alternatives;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Many a subtle argument they laid forth;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;They speak of magic and deception.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But finally, in conclusion,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;They can not see any advantage in that,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nor in any other way, save for marriage.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Then saw they in that such difficulty<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;By way of reason, to speak all plainly, <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Because there was such difference<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Between their two religions, that they say<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;They suppose that no "Christian prince would be willing<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To wed his child under our sweet religion<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That was taught us by Mohammed, our prophet."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And he answered, "Rather than I lose<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Custance, I will be christened, doubtless.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I must be hers; I can choose no other.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I pray you to keep your arguments silent;  <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Save my life, and be not negligent <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To get her who has my life in her keeping,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For in this woe I can not long endure."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;What needs greater increase of words?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I say, by treaty and negotiation,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And by the pope's mediation,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And all the church, and all the knights,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That for the destruction of idolatry,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And for the increase of Christ's dear law,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;They are agreed, as you shall hear:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That the Sultan and his baronage<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And all his vassals should christened be,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And he shall have Custance in marriage,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And a certain amount of gold, I do not know how much;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And for this provided sufficient pledges.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This same agreement was sworn on either side;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Now, fair Custance, almighty God thee guide!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Now would some men expect, as I guess,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That I should tell all the preparations<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That the Emperor, of his great nobility,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Has arranged for his daughter, Lady Custance.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Well may men know that such great preparation<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;No man can tell in a brief statement<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As was provided for so important an occasion.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Bishops are appointed to go with her,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Lords, ladies, knights of renown,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And other folk enough; this is the sum of it;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And it is made known throughout the town<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That every person, with great devotion,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Should pray Christ that He this marriage<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Receive favorably and lend success to this voyage. <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The day is come of her departure;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I say, the woeful fatal day is come,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That there may be no longer tarrying,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But  to go forth they prepare themselves, one and all.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Custance, that was with sorrow all overcome,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Full pale arises, and prepares herself to go;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For well she sees there is no other possible conclusion. <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Alas, what wonder is it though she wept,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She who shall be sent to a foreign nation<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;From friends who so tenderly cared for her,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And to be bound under subjection<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;By one, (of whom) she knows not his character?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Husbands are all good, and have been for years;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Wives know that; I dare say you no more.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Father," she said, "thy wretched child Custance,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Thy young daughter fostered up so tenderly,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And you, my mother, my greatest joy<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Over all things, except Christ above,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Custance your child commends herself often<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Unto your grace, for I must go to Syria,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nor shall I never see you again with my eyes.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Alas, unto the pagan world<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I must go right now, since it is your will;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But Christ, that died for our redemption<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Give me grace his commands to fulfill!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I, wretched woman, no matter though I die!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Women are born to servitude and suffering,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And to be under man's governance."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I believe at Troy, when Pirrus broke the wall<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Before Ilion burned, at Thebes the city,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nor at Rome, for the harm wrought by Hannibal<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Who has vanquished Romans three times,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Was not heard such tender weeping for pity<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As in the chamber was for her departing;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But forth she must go, whether she weeps or sings.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;O first moving! Cruel firmament,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With thy daily motion that pushes ever<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And hurls all from east to west<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That naturally would go the other way,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Thy impetus set the heaven in such an arrangement<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;At the beginning of this dangerous voyage,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That cruel Mars has slain this marriage.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Unfortunate ascending oblique house, [see n.]<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;From which the lord, helpless, has fallen, alas,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Out of his angle into the most unfavorable house!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;O Mars, o dominant planet, in this case!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;O feeble moon, unhappy are thy steps!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Thou join thyself where thou art not (well) received;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Where thou were well, from thence art thou driven away.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Imprudent Emperor of Rome, alas!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Was there no astrologer in all thy town?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Is no time better than another in such a case?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For voyages is there no choice of a favorable time,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Especially for folk of noble social status?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Not when an exact date of a birth is known?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Alas, we are too ignorant or too slow in wit!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To ship is brought this woeful fair maid<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Solemnly, with every ceremony.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Now Jesus Christ be with you all!" she said;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There is no more, but "Farewell, fair Custance!"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She takes pains to make a cheerful appearance;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And forth I let her sail in this manner,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And turn I will again to my subject matter.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The mother of the Sultan, well of vices,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Espied has her son's full intention,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;How he will leave his old sacrifices;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And right away she sent for her council,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And they are come to know what she intended.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And when this folk was assembled together,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She set herself down, and said as you shall hear.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Lords," said she, "you know each one of you,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;How my son is about to forsake<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The holy laws of our Koran,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Given by God's messenger Mohammed.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But one vow to great God I promise,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The life shall rather out of my body go<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Before Mohammed's law (goes) out of my heart!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"What should come to us from this new religion<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Except slavery to our bodies and suffering,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And afterward to be dragged into hell,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Because we renounced our faith in Mohammed?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But, lords, will you make assurance,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As I shall say, assenting to my teaching,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And I shall make us safe for evermore?"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;They swore and agree, every man,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To live with her and die, and by her stand,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And every one, in the best way he can,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To strengthen her shall try (to persuade) all his friends;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And she has this enterprise taken in hand,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Which you shall hear as I shall tell,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And to them all she spoke right in this manner:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"We shall first pretend to receive Christendom --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Cold water shall not grieve us but a little! --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And I shall such a feast and revel make<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That, as I believe, I shall pay back the Sultan.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For though his wife be christened never so white,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She shall have need to wash away the red,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Though she a baptismal font full of water bring with her."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;O Sultaness, root of iniquity!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Virago, thou Semiramis the second!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;O serpent under (cover of) femininity,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Like the serpent deep in hell bound!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;O feigned woman, that can destroy all <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Virtue and innocence, through thy malice,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That is bred in thee, nest of every vice!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;O Satan, envious since that same day<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That thou were chased from our heritage,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Well knowest thou the old way to women!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Thou madest Eva bring us into slavery;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Thou wilt destroy this Christian marriage.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Thy instrument thus -- alas the times! --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Makest thou of women, when thou wilt deceive.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This Sultaness, whom I thus blame and curse,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Privately had her council go their way.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Why should I in this tale longer tarry?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She rides to the Sultan on a day,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And said to him that she would renounce her religion,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And take Christendom from a priest's hands,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Repenting that she heathen was so long,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Beseeching him to do her that honor,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That she might have the Christian folk to feast --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"To please them I will work hard."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Sultan says, "I will act according to your command."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And kneeling thanks her for that request.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So glad he was, he knew not what to say.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She kissed her son, and home she goes her way.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This Christian folk have come to land	<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In Syria, with a great solemn company,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And hastily this Sultan sent his messenger<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;First to his mother, and all the reign about,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And said his wife was come, without doubt,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And prayed her to ride to meet the queen,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The honor of his reign to sustain.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Large was the crowd, and rich was the assembly<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Of Syrians and Romans met together;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The mother of the Sultan, richly dressed and gay,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Receives her with as glad a demeanor<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As any mother might have for her daughter dear,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And to the nearest city there beside<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;At a slow pace solemnly they ride.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I do not believe the triumph of Julius,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Of which Lucan makes such a boastful account,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Was more royal nor more splendid<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Than was the assembly of this blissful host.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But this scorpion, this wicked spirit,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Sultaness, for all her flattering,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Planned, under cover of this, very mortally to sting.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Sultan comes himself soon after this<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So royally that it is a wonder to tell,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And welcomes her with all joy and bliss.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And thus in mirth and joy I let them remain;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The essential part of this matter is what I tell.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When time came, men thought it for the best<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That revel should stint, and people go to their rest.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The time having come, this old Sultaness<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Has arranged this feast of which I told,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And to the feast Christian folk go<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;All together, yes, both young and old.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Here may men behold feasting and royalty,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And dainties more than I can tell you;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But all too dear they paid for it before they rise (from the feast).<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;O sudden woe, that ever art successor<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To worldly bliss, sprinkled with bitterness,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The end of the joy of our worldly labor!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Woe takes over at the end of our gladness.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Hearken to this counsel for thy safety:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Upon thy glad day have in thy mind<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The unexpected woe or harm that follows.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For shortly to tell, at one word,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Sultan and the Christians each one<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Are all hacked to pieces and stabbed at the table,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Except for only Lady Custance alone.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This old Sultaness, cursed crone,	<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Has with her friends done this cursed deed,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For she herself wanted to rule all the country.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nor there was any Syrian that was converted,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Who knew of the counsel of the Sultan (followed his advice),<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Who was not all hacked to pieces before he could escape.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And Custance have they taken right then, immediately, <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And in a ship entirely without a rudder, God knows,	<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;They have set her, and told her to learn to sail<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Out of Syria back to Italy.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A certain amount of treasure that she brought there,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And, to say the truth, a great store of provisions<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;They have given her, and clothes also she had, <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And forth she sails in the salt see.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;O my Custance, full of goodness,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;O Emperor's young daughter dear,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He that is lord of Fortune be thy rudder!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She blesses herself, and with full pitiful voice<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Unto the cross of Christ thus said she:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"O clear, o blessed altar, holy cross,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Red with the blood of the Lamb full of pity,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That washed the world from the old iniquity,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Keep me from the fiend and from his claws,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That day that I shall drown in the deep.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Victorious tree, protection of true (believers),<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That alone was worthy to bear<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The King of Heaven with his fresh wounds,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The white Lamb, that hurt was with a spear,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Banisher of fiends out of man and woman<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Over which thy limbs faithfully extend,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Guard me, and give me power my life to amend."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Years and days floated this creature<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Throughout the Sea of Greece unto the Strait<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Of Gibraltar, as it was her lot.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;On many a sorry meal now may she feed;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Full often may she expect her death,<BR> 
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Before the wild waves will drive her<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Unto the place where she shall come to land.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Men might ask why she was not slain<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Also at the feast? Who could save her body?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And I answer to that question in reply,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Who saved Daniel in the horrible cave<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Where every person except for him, master and servant,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Was devoured by the lion before he could escape?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;No one but God Whom he bore in his heart.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;God wanted to show his wonderful miracle<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In her, so that we should see his mighty works;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Christ, Who is a medicine for every harm,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;By certain means often, as know clerks,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Does something for a certain reason that is very obscure<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To man's understanding, which, because of our ignorance,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Can not know His prudent foresight.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Now since she was not slain at the feast,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Who kept her from the drowning in the sea?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Who kept Jonas in the fish's maw<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Until he was spouted up at Nineveh?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Well may men know it was no one but He<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Who kept the Hebrew people from their drowning,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With dry feet through the sea passing.  <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Who commanded the four spirits of tempest<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That have power to harm land and sea,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Both north and south, and also west and east,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Harm neither sea, nor land, nor tree"?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Truly, the commander of that was He<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Who from the tempest always this woman guarded<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As well when she woke as when she slept.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Where could this woman have food and drink<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Three years and more? How lasts her store of provisions?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Who fed the Egyptian Mary in the cave,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Or in desert? No person but Christ, without doubt.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It was as great marvel five thousand folk<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To feed with five loaves and two fish.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;God sent his plenty at their great need.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She drives forth into our ocean<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Throughout our wild sea, until at the last<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Next to a castle that I can not name,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Far in Northumberland the waves cast her,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And in the sand her ship stuck so fast<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That thence it would not (move) for the duration of an entire tide;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The will of Christ was that she should remain there.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The constable of the castle down has come<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To see this wreck, and all the ship he searched,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And found this weary woman full of care;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He found also the treasure that she brought.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In her language mercy she besought,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The life out of her body to take away,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Her to deliver from the woe that she was in.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A sort of corrupt Latin was her speech,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But nonetheless by means of this she was understood.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The constable, when he desired no longer to search,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This woeful woman he brought to the land.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She kneels down and gives thanks for what God has sent;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But who she was she would tell no man,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For anything, though she should die.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She said she was so bewildered in the sea<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That she lost her memory, by her pledged word (she swore).<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The constable has for her such great pity,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And also his wife, that they weep for pity.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She was so diligent, without laziness,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To serve and please every one in that place<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That all who look in her face love her.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This constable and Lady Hermengild, his wife,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Were pagans, and (so was) that country everywhere;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But Hermengild loved her as much as her life,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And Custance has so long lived there,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In prayers, with many a bitter tear,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Until Jesus has converted through his grace<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Dame Hermengild, wife of the constable of that place.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In all that land no Christians dared assemble;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;All Christian folk have fled from that country<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Because of pagans, that conquered all about<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The coastal regions of the north, by land and sea.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To Wales fled the Christian people<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Of old Britons dwelling in this isle;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There was their refuge at that time.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But yet Christian Britons were not so (completely) exiled<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That there were not some that in their secrecy<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Honored Christ and deceived the heathen folk,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And near the castle there dwelt three such (Christians).<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The one of them was blind and could not see,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Unless it were with those eyes of his mind<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With which men see, after they have become blind.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Bright was the sun in that summer's day,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For which the constable and his wife also<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And Custance have taken the direct route<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Toward the sea an eighth of a mile or two,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To amuse themselves and to roam to and fro,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And in their walk this blind man they met,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Bent over and old, with eyes fast shut.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"In the name of Christ," cried this blind Briton,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Dame Hermengild, give me my sight again!"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This lady grew afraid of these words,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Lest that her husband, shortly to say,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Would have slain her for Jesus Christ's love,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Until Custance made her bold, and told her to work<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The will of Christ, as daughter of his church.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The constable grew troubled at that sight,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And said, "What does all this business mean?"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Custance answered, "Sir, it is Christ's might,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That helps folk out of the fiend's snare."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And so completely she did our religion explain<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That she the constable, before it was evening,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Converts, and made him believe in Christ.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This constable was in no way lord of this place<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Of which I speak, where he Custance found,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But kept it securely many a winter's space of time<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Under Alla, king of all Northumberland,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Who was full wise, and worthy of his hand (a mighty warrior)<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Against the Scots, as men may well hear;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But I will turn again to my subject.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Satan, that ever waits (for a chance) to trick us,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Saw of Custance all her perfection,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And considered right away how he might repay her, <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And made a young knight that dwelt in that town<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Love her so passionately, by foul desire,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That truly he thought he should die,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Unless he might once have his will of her.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He woos her, but it avails not;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She would do no sin, in no way.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And for malice he plotted in his mind<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To make her in a shameful death to die.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He waits until the constable was away,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And secretly one night he crept<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In Hermengild's bedroom, while she slept.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Weary, exhausted because of her prayers,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Sleeps Custance, and Hermengild also.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This knight, through Satan's temptations,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Very quietly has gone to the bed,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And cut the throat of Hermengild in two,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And laid the bloody knife by Lady Custance,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And went his way, may God give him misfortune!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Soon after, this constable comes home again,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And also Alla, who was king of that land,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And saw his wife mercilessly slain,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For which full often he wept and wrung his hands,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And in the bed the bloody knife he found<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;By Lady Custance. Alas, what could she say?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For sheer woe her wit was all away.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To king Alla was told all this misfortune,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And also the time, and where, and in what manner<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That in a ship was found this Custance,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As before this you have heard tell.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The king's heart for pity trembled,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When he saw so good a creature<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Fallen in distress and in misfortune.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For as the lamb toward its death is brought,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So stands this innocent before the king.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This false knight, who has this treason wrought,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Falsely testifies that she has done this thing.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But nonetheless, there was great mourning<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Among the people, and they say they can not imagine<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That she had done so great a wickedness,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For they have seen her always so virtuous,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And loving Hermengild as much as her life.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Of this bore witness every one in that house,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Except for him who slew Hermengild with his knife.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This gentle king was deeply moved<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;By this witness, and thought he would enquire<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Deeper in this, to learn the truth.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Alas! Custance, thou hast no champion,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And fight can thou not, alas!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But He that died for our redemption,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And bound Satan (and he yet lies where he lay),<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So be thy strong champion this day!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For, unless Christ a clear miracle reveals,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Without guilt thou shalt be slain immediately.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She set herself down on knees, and thus she said:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Immortal God, that savedest Susannah<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;From false blame, and thou, merciful maid,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mary I mean, daughter to Saint Anne,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Before whose child angels sing Hosanna,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;If I be guiltless of this felony,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;My succor be, for otherwise I shall dye!"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Have you not seen sometime a pale face,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Among a crowd, of him that has been led<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Toward his death, where he got no reprieve,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And such a color in his face has had<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Men might know his face that was in trouble<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Amongst all the faces in that route?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So stands Custance, and looks around her.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;O queens, living in prosperity,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Duchesses, and you ladies each one,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Have some pity on her adversity!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;An Emperor's daughter stands alone;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She has no person to whom to lament (plead for help).<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;O blood royal, that stands in this dreadful state,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Far away are thy friends at thy great need!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This king Alla has such compassion,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Since a noble heart is filled with pity,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That from his eyes ran the water down.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Now hastily have a book fetched," said he,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"And if this knight will swear how that she<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Slew this woman, then will we think carefully about<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Whom we desire to be our judge (i.e., bring her to trial)."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A British book, in which were written the gospels,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Was fetched, and on this book he swore at once <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That she was guilty, and in the same moment<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A hand struck him upon the neck-boon,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That down he fell at once like a stone,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And both his eyes burst out of his face<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In sight of every body in that place.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A voice was heard by everyone there,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And it said, "Thou hast slandered, guiltless,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The daughter of holy church in the presence of the High One (God);<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Thus hast thou done, and yet I hold my peace!"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Of this marvel terrified was all the crowd of people;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Like bewildered folk they stood each one,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For fear of vengeance, except for Custance alone.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Great was the fear and also the repentance<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Of them that had a wrong suspicion<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Of this blessed innocent, Custance;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And because of this miracle, in conclusion,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And by Custance's mediation,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The king -- and many another in that place --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Converted was, thanked be Christ's grace!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This false knight was slain for his untruth<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;By judgment of Alla immediately;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And yet Custance had for his death great pity.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And after this Jesus, of His mercy,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Made Alla wed full solemnly<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This holy maiden, that is so bright and beautiful;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And thus has Christ made Custance a queen.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But who was woeful, if I shall not lie,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Of this wedding but Donegild, and no others,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The king's mother, full of tyranny?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She thought her cursed heart broke in two.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She wished that her son had not done so;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She thought it an insult that he should take<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So foreign a creature as his mate.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I do not want of the chaff, nor of the straw,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To make so long a tale as of the grain (the essential part).<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Why should I tell of the royalty<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;At the marriage, or which course goes before;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Who blows in a trumpet or in a horn?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The fruit (the essential part) of every tale is to be told:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;They eat, and drink, and dance, and sing, and play.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;They go to bed, as it was reasonable and right;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For though wives are full holy things,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;They must take in patience at night<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Such sorts of necessary acts as are pleasing<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To folk that have wedded them with rings,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And (they must) lay their holiness aside a little while,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As for the time being -- it can be no better.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;On her he begot a male child quickly,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And to a bishop, and his constable also,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He gave his wife to protect, when he is gone<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Toward Scotland, his foemen to seek.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Now fair Custance, who is so humble and meek,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So long is gone with child, until that quietly<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She keeps to her chamber, abiding Christ's will.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The time is come a male child she bore;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mauricius at the baptismal font they call him.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This constable orders a messenger to come forth,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And wrote unto his king, who was called Alla,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;How this blissful event has occurred,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And other tidings useful to be said.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He takes the letter, and forth he goes his way.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This messenger, to do (something for) his profit,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Unto the king's mother rides quickly,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And salutes her full fair in his language:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Madame," said he, "you may be glad and happy,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And thank God a hundred thousand times!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;My lady queen has a child, without doubt,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As a joy and bliss to all this reign about.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Lo, here (are) the letters sealed of this business,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That I must bear with all the haste I can.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;If you will (send) anything unto your son the king,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I am at your service, both night and day."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Donegild answered, "Right now, at this time, no;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But here all night I want that thou take thy rest.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Tomorrow will I say to thee what I wish."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This messenger drank heavily ale and wine,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And stolen were his letters secretly<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Out of his box, while he slept like a pig;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And counterfeited was full subtly<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Another letter, made full sinfully,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Directed unto the king concerning this matter<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;From his constable, as you shall after hear.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The letter said the queen delivered was<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Of so horrible a fiendish creature<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That in the castle no one was so bold<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That for any length of time dared to remain near it.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The mother was an evil spirit, by chance<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Come, by charms or by sorcery,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And every person hates her company.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Woe was this king when he this letter had seen,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But to no person he told his painful sorrows,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But by his own hand he wrote in answer,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Welcome be the dispensation of Christ for evermore<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To me that am now learned in his teaching!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Lord, welcome be thy desire and thy pleasure;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I put all my will in thy governance.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Guard this child, whether it be foul or fair,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And also my wife, until my home-coming.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Christ, when He pleases, may send me an heir<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Moore agreeable than this to my desire."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This letter he seals, secretly weeping,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Which to the messenger was given soon,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And forth he goes; there is nothing more to do.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;O messenger, filled with drunkenness,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Strong is thy breath, thy limbs ever tremble,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And thou betray all secrets.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Thy mind is lost, thou chatter like a jay,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Thy face is completely changed. <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Where drunkenness reigns in any group,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There is no secret hidden, without doubt.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;O Donegild, I do not have any English suitable (to describe)<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Unto thy malice and thy tyranny!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And therefore to the fiend I thee consign;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Let him write about thy treachery!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Fie, like a man, fie! -- o nay, by God, I lie --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Fie, like a fiendish spirit, for I dare well tell,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Though thou here walk, thy spirit is in hell!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This messenger comes from the king again,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And at the king's mother's court he dismounted,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And she was very happy because of this messenger,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And (she) pleased him in all that ever she could.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He drank, and well stuffed (drink) under his belt;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He sleeps, and he snorts in his way<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;All night, until the sun did arise.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Again were his letters stolen every one,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And counterfeited letters in this manner:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"The king commands his constable at once,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Upon pain of hanging, and of strict judicial punishment,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That he should not allow in any manner<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Custance within his realm to remain<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Three days and a quarter of duration of a tide (three hours);<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"But in the same ship as he her found,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Her, and her young son, and all her gear,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He should put, and push her from the land,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And command her that she never again come here."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;O my Custance, well may thy spirit have fear,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And, sleeping, in thy dream to be in suffering,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When Donegild devised all this plan.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This messenger in the morning, when he awoke,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Unto the castle goes the nearest way,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And to the constable he gave the letter;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And when that he this pitiful letter saw,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Full often he said, "Alas and woe!"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Lord Christ," said he, "how can this world endure,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So full of sin is so many a creature?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"O mighty God, if it be thy will,	<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Since thou art rightful judge, how may it be<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That thou wilt allow innocents to die,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And wicked folk to reign in prosperity?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;O good Custance, alas, so woeful am I<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That I must be thy tormentor, or die<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In a shameful death; there is no other way."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Weep both young and old in all that place<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When the king this cursed letter sent,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And Custance, with a deadly pale face,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The fourth day toward her ship she went.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But nonetheless she takes in good faith<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The will of Christ, and kneeling on the strand,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She said, "Lord, always welcome be thy dispensation!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"He that me kept from the false blame<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;While I was on the land amongst you,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He can keep me from harm and also from shame<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In the salt sea, although I see not how.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As strong as ever He was, He is yet now.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In Him trust I, and in his mother dear,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Who is to me my sail and also my rudder."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Her little child lay weeping in her arm,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And kneeling, pitifully to him she said,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Peace, little son, I will do thee no harm."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With that her kerchief off her head she pulled,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And over his little eyes she it laid,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And in her arm she lulls it fast asleep,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And into heaven her eyes up she caste.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Mother," said she, "and maiden bright, Mary,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;True it is that through woman's instigation<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mankind was lost, and damned forever to die,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For which thy child was on a cross stretched.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Thy blissful eyes saw all his torment;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Then is there no comparison between<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Thy woe and any woe man may sustain.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Thou saw thy child slain before thy eyes,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And yet now lives my little child, in faith!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Now, lady bright, to whom all woeful (people) cry,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Thou glory of womanhood, thou fair maiden,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Thou haven of refuge, bright star of day,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Have pity on my child, (thou who) of thy nobility<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Takes pity on every wretched person in distress.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"O little child, alas! What is thy guilt,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That never did sin as yet, in faith?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Why will thy hard father have thee killed?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;O mercy, dear constable," said she,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Let my little child remain here with thee;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And if thou dare not save him, for fear of punishment,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Kiss him once in his father's name!"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Therewith she looked backward to the land,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And said, "Farewell, ruthless husband!"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And up she rises, and walks down the strand<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Toward the ship -- all the crowd follows her --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And ever she prays her child to hold his peace;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And takes her leave, and with a holy attitude<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She blesses herself, and into the ship she went.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Supplied with food was the ship, it is no doubt,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Abundantly for her very long time (of sailing),<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And other necessities that should be needed<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She had enough -- praised be God's grace!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For wind and weather almighty God provide,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And bring her home! I can no better say,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But in the sea she drives forth on her way.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Alla the king comes home soon after this<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Unto his castle, of the which I told,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And asks where his wife and his child is.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The constable began about his heart to grow cold,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And plainly the whole affair he him told<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As you have heard -- I can tell it no better --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And shows the king his seal and also his letter,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And said, "Lord, as you commanded me<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Upon pain of death, so have I done, certainly."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This messenger tortured was until he<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Had to reveal and tell, bluntly and plainly,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;From night to night, in what place he had lain;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And thus, by wit and subtle questioning,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Deduced was by whom this harm did spring.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The hand was known that the letter wrote,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And all the venom of this cursed deed,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But in what manner (this was done), certainly, I know not.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The effect is this: that Alla, without doubt,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;His mother slew -- that may men plainly read --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Because she traitor was to her allegiance.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Thus ends old Donegild, with bad luck to her!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The sorrow that this Alla night and day<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Makes for his wife, and for his child also,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There is no tongue that it can tell.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But now will I go unto Custance,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Who floats in the sea, in pain and woe,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Five years and more, as it pleased Christ's dispensation,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Before her ship approached unto land.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Alongside a heathen castle, at the last,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Of which the name in my text I do not find,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Custance, and also her child, the sea up cast. <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Almighty God, that saves all mankind,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Have for Custance and for her child some thought,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Who fallen is in heathen hand once more,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;On the point of dying, as I shall tell you soon.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Down from the castle comes there many a person<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To stare on this ship and on Custance.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But shortly, from the castle, on a night,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The lord's steward -- God give him bad luck! --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A thief, that had renounced our religion,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Came into ship alone, and said he should<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Her lover be, whether she would or would not.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Woebegone then was this wretched woman;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Her child cried, and she cried pitifully.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But blissful Mary helped her right then;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For with her struggling well and mightily<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The thief fell over board all suddenly,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And in the sea he drowned as a punishment;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And thus has Christ kept Custance undefiled.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;O foul lust of lechery, lo, thy end!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Not only that thou make man's mind grow faint,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But truly thou wilt his body destroy.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The end of thy work, or of thy blind desires,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Is lamentation. How many a one may men find<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That not for the deed sometimes, but for the intention<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To do this sin, are either slain or destroyed!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;How may this weak woman have this strength<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Herself to defend against this renegade?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;O Goliath, immeasurable of height,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;How could David make thee so defeated,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So young and so lacking in arms and armor?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;How dared he look upon thy dreadful face?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Well may men see, it was nothing but God's grace.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Who gave Judith courage or hardiness<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To slay that Holofernes in his tent,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And to deliver out of wretchedness<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The people of God? I say, for this purpose,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That just as God the spirit of vigor sent<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To them and saved them out of misfortune,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So sent he might and vigor to Custance.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Forth goes her ship throughout the narrow mouth<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Of Gibraltar and Morocco, driving ever<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Sometimes west, and sometimes north and south,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And sometimes east, full many a weary day,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Until Christ's mother -- blessed be she always! --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Has devised a plan, through her endless goodness,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To make an end of all her sadness.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Now let us stint of Custance but a short while,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And speak we of the Roman Emperor,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That out of Syria has by letters known<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The slaughter of Christian folk, and dishonor<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Done to his daughter by a false traitor,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I mean the cursed wicked Sultaness<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That at the feast caused to be slain both high ranking and low.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For which this Emperor has sent at once<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;His senator, with royal armaments,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And other lords, God knows, many a one,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;On Syrians to take great vengeance.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;They burn, slay, and bring them to misery<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Full many a day; but shortly -- this is the end --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Homeward to Rome they prepared themselves to wend.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This senator goes with victory<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Toward Rome, sailing full royally,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And met the ship sailing, as says the story,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In which Custance sits full piteously.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In no way knew he who she was, nor why<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She was in such a state, she will not tell<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Of her rank, although she should die.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He brings her to Rome, and to his wife<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He gave her, and her young son also;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And with the senator she led her life.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Thus can Our Lady bring out of woe<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Woeful Custance, and many another more.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And long time dwelled she in that place,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In holy works ever, as was her special gift of God.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The senator's wife was her aunt,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But for all that she knew her never the more.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I will no longer tarry in this case,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But to king Alla, whom I spoke of formerly,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Who for his wife weeps and sighs sore,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I will return, and I will leave Custance<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Under the senator's governance.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;King Alla, who had his mother slain,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Upon a day fell in such repentance<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That, if I shortly tell shall and plainly,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To Rome he comes to receive his penance;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And put him in the Pope's governance<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In all things, and Jesus Christ besought<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To forgive his wicked deeds that he did.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The news at once through Rome town is carried,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;How Alla king shall come in pilgrimage,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;By arrangers of lodging that went before him;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For which the senator, as was the custom,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Rode to meet him, and many of his lineage,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As well to show his high magnificence<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As to do any king a reverence.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Great friendliness shows this noble senator<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To king Alla, and he to him also;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Every one of them does the other great honor.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And so it happened that in a day or two<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This senator is to king Alla gone<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To feast, and shortly, if I shall not lie,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Custance's son went in his company.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Some men would say at request of Custance<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This senator has led this child to the feast;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I can not tell every detail --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Be as be may, there he was at the least.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But the truth is this, that at his mother's command<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Before Alla, during the meal time,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The child stood, looking in the king's face.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This king Alla has of this child great wonder,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And to the senator he said at once,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Whose is that fair child that stands yonder?"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I do not know," said he, "by God, and by Saint John!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A mother he has, but father has he none<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That I know of" -- and shortly, in a little while,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He told Alla how this child was found.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"But God knows," said this senator also,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"So virtuous a liver in my life<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Saw I never as she, nor heard of more,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Of worldly women, maiden, nor of wife.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I dare well say she had rather have a knife<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Through her breast, than be a woman wicked;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There is no man could bring her to that point."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Now was this child as like unto Custance<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As it is possible for a creature to be.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This Alla has the face in remembrance<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Of Lady Custance, and thereon mused he<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;If the child's mother were in any way she<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Who is his wife, and secretly he sighed,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And sped himself from the table as fast as he could.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"In faith," thought he, "hallucination is in my head!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I ought to believe, by reasonable judgment,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That in the salt sea my wife is dead."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And afterward he made his contrary argument:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"What know I if Christ has hither sent<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;My wife by sea, as well as he her sent<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To my country from thence that she went?"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And after noon, home with the senator<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Goes Alla, to see this wonderful happening.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This senator does Alla great honor,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And hastily he sent after Custance.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But trust well, she did not want to dance<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When she knew the reason for that summons;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Hardly upon her feet she could stand.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When Alla saw his wife, gently he greeted her,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And wept that it was a pity to see;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For at the first look he on her set<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He knew well indeed that it was she.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And she, for sorrow, stands as dumb as a tree,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So was her heart shut (pressed by emotion) in her distress,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When she remembered his unnatural cruelty.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Twice she swooned in his own sight;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He wept, and himself excuses piteously.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Now God," said he, "and his saints bright<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As surely as they may have mercy on my soul,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(I swear) that of your harm I am as guiltless<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As is Maurice my son, whose face is so like yours;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Otherwise (may) the fiend me fetch out of this place!"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Long was the sobbing and the bitter pain,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Before their woeful hearts might cease (giving pain);<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Great was the pity to hear them lament,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Through which lamentations began their woe to increase.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I pray you to release me from all my labor;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I can not tell their woe until to-morrow,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I am so weary from speaking of sorrow.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But finally, when the truth is known<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That Alla was guiltless of her woe,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I believe a hundred times they have kissed,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And such a bliss is there between them two<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That, except for the joy that lasts evermore,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There is none like it that any creature<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Has seen or shall (see), while the world may endure.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Then prayed she her husband meekly,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In relief of her long, pitiful pain,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That he would pray her father specially<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That of his majesty he would incline<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To grant some day with him to dine.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She prayed him also he should by no means<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Unto her father say any word of her.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Some men would say that the child Maurice<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Takes this message unto this Emperor;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But, as I guess, Alla was not so foolish<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To him that was of such high honor<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As he that is of Christian folk the flower,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To have sent any child, but it is better to believe<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He went himself, and that would be most fitting.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This Emperor has agreed nobly<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To come to dinner, as he him requested;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And well read I (in my source) he looked intently<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Upon this child, and thought about his daughter.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Alla goes to his inn, and as he should,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Prepared for this feast in every way<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So far as his ability may suffice.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The morning came, and Alla began to prepare himself,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And also his wife, to meet this Emperor;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And forth they ride in joy and in gladness.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And when she saw her father in the street,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She dismounted, and falls to his feet.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Father," said she, "your young child Custance<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Is now completely out of your remembrance.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I am your daughter Custance," said she,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Whom long ago you have sent unto Syria.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It am I, father, that in the salt sea<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Was put alone and damned to die.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Now, good father, mercy I beg of you!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Send me no more unto any heathen country,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But thank my lord here of his kindnesses."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Who can tell all the pitiful joy <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Between them three, since they are thus met?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But of my tale I shall make an end;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The day goes fast, I will no longer delay.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This glad folk to dinner they themselves set;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In joy and bliss at their meal I let them remain<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A thousand fold well more (blissful) than I can tell.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This child Maurice was later Emperor<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Made by the Pope, and lived in a Christian manner;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To Christ's church he did great honor.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But I let all his story pass by;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Of Custance is my tale in particular.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In the old Roman histories may men find<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Maurice's life; I bear it not in mind.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This king Alla, when he his time saw,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With his Custance, his holy wife so sweet,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To England are they come by the direct route,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Where they live in joy and in quiet.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But little while it lasts, I you promise,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Joy of this world, because time will not stand still;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;From day to night it changes like the tide.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Who lived ever in such delight one day<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That he was not moved by either conscience,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Or anger, or desire, or some kind of fear,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Envy, or pride, or passion, or offence?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I make this statement only for this conclusion,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That little while in joy or in pleasure<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Lasts the bliss of Alla with Custance.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For Death, that takes of high ranking and low his payment,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When passed was a year, as I suppose,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Out of this world this king Alla he seized,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For whom Custance has full great sadness.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Now let us pray God his soul be blessed!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And Lady Custance, finally to say,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Toward the town of Rome goes her way.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To Rome has come this holy creature,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And finds her friends whole and sound;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Now has she escaped all her adventure.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And when she her father has found,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Down on her knees falls she to ground;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Weeping for tenderness blithe in heart,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She praises God a hundred thousand times.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In virtue and in holy charitable works<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;They all live, and never parted;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Until death departs them, this life they lead.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And fare now well! my tale is at an end.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Now Jesus Christ, that of his might may send<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Joy after woe, govern us in his grace,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And keep us all that are in this place! Amen<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;[Our Host upon his stirrups stood up at once,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And said, "Good men, listen every one!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This was a excellent tale for this occasion!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Sir Parish Priest," said he, "for God's bones,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Tell us a tale, as was thy previous agreement.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I see well that you men learned in lore<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Know much that is good, by God's dignity!"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Parson him answered, "Bless me!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;What ails the man, so sinfully to swear?"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Our Host answered, "O Jankin, are you there?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I smell a Lollard in the wind," said he.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Now! good men," said our Host, "listen to me;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Wait, for God's worthy passion,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For we shall have a sermon;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This Lollard here will preach us something."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Nay, by my father's soul, that shall he not!"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Said the Shipman, "Here shall he not preach;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He shall no gospel interpret here nor teach.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We all believe in the great God," said he;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"He would sow some difficulty,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Or sprinkle weeds in our clean grain.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And therefore, Host, I warn thee beforehand,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;My handsome body shall tell a tale,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And I shall clink you so merry a bell,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That I shall awaken all this company.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But it shall not be of philosophy,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nor legal cases, nor elaborate terms of law.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There is but little Latin in my maw!"]<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There is, at the west side of Italy,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Down at the foot of Vesulus the cold,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A lusty plain, abundant with food crops,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Where many a tower and town thou may behold,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That were founded in time of fathers old,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And many another delectable sight,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And Saluces this noble country is called.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A marquis once was lord of that land,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As were his worthy elders before him;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And obedient, ever ready to his hand (to do his commands),<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Were all his subjects, both lesser ranks and nobles.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thus in delight he lives, and has done since long before,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Beloved and feared, through favor of Fortune,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Both by his lords and by his citizenry.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Moreover he was, to speak of lineage,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The most noble born in Lombardy,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A handsome person, and strong, and young of age,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And full of honor and of courtesy;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Discreet enough to govern his country,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Except in some things he was to blame;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And Walter was this young lord's name.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I blame him thus: that he considered not<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In time coming what might happen to him,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But on his immediate pleasure was all his thought,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Such as to hawk and hunt on every side.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Well nigh all other cares he let slip away,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And also he would not -- and that was worst of all --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Wed any woman, for anything that may befall.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Only that point his people took so badly<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That in groups on one day they went to him,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And one of them, that wisest was in learning --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or else the one that the lord most readily would consent<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That he should tell him what his people meant,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or else he knew well how to present such a matter --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He to the marquis said as you shall hear:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "O noble marquis, your graciousness<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Makes us confident and gives us boldness,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As often as it is time (to do so) by necessity,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That we to you may tell our sorrow.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Grant, lord, now of your nobility<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That we with pitiful heart may unto you complain,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And let your ears not disdain (to hear) my voice.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Although I have nothing to do in this matter<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; More than another man has in this place,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Yet for as much as you, my lord so dear,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Have always shown me favor and grace<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I dare the more confidently to ask of you a time<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of hearing to present our request,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And you, my lord, to do right as it may please you.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "For certainly, lord, so well you please us <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And all your actions, and ever have done so, that we<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Could not ourselves imagine how<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We might live in more happiness,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Save one thing, lord, if it be your will,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That you would desire to be a wedded man;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Then your people would be in complete peace of mind.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Bow your neck under that blissful yoke<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of sovereignty, not of servitude,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Which men call marriage or wedlock;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And think, lord, among your wise thoughts <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; How our days pass in various ways,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For though we sleep, or wake, or roam, or ride,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Ever flees the time; it will wait for no man.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "And though your green youth flowers as yet,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In creeps age always, as still as stone,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And death menaces every age, and smites<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In each rank, for there escapes no one;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And just as certainly as we know, each one of us,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That we shall die, as uncertain we all<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Are of that day when death shall on us fall.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Accept then the true intent of us,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who never yet refused your command,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And we will, lord, if you will assent,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Chose a wife for you, in short time at the least,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Born of the most noble and of the greatest (in rank)<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of all this land, so that it must seem<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Honor to God and you, so far as we can judge.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Deliver us out of all this constant fear,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And take a wife, for high God's sake!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For if it so happen, may God forbid,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That through your death your line should die out,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And that a foreign successor should take<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Your heritage, O woe would it be to us in our lifetime!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Wherefore we pray you hastily to take a wife."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Their meek prayer and their pitiful manner<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Made the marquis's heart have pity.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "You want," said he, "my own people dear,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That which I never before thought to compel myself.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I rejoiced in my liberty,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That seldom is found in marriage;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Where I was free, I must be in servitude.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "But nevertheless I see your true intent,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And trust upon your intelligence, and always have done so;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Therefore of my free will I will assent<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To wed, as soon as ever I can.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But insofar as you have offered me to-day<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To choose me a wife, I release you <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (From making) that choice and pray you to cease (making) that offer.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "For God knows it, that children often are<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Unlike their worthy elders (who came) before them;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; All goodness comes from God, not from the lineage<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; By which they are conceived and born.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I trust in God's goodness, and therefore<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; My marriage and my estate and peace of mind <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I entrust to him; he may do as he pleases.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Let me alone in the choosing of my wife --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That responsibility upon my back I will endure.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But I you pray, and order you upon your life,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Whatever wife I take, you me assure<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To honor her, while her life may endure,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In word and deed, both here and everywhere,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As if she were an emperor's daughter.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "And furthermore, this shall you swear: that you<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Against my choice shall neither grouch nor strive;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For since I must forgo my liberty<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; At your request, as ever I may thrive,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Where my heart is set, there will I take a wife;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And unless you will assent in such a manner,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I pray you, speak no more of this matter."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With heartfelt will they swore and assent<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To all this thing -- there said no person nay --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Beseeching him of grace, before they went,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That he would grant them a fixed day<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of his wedding, as soon as ever he can;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For yet always the people somewhat dreaded,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Lest the marquis no wife would wed.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He granted them a day, such as he pleased,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; On which he would be wedded surely,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And said he did all this at their request.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And they, with humble good will, obediently,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Kneeling upon their knees full reverently,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; All thanked him; and thus they have a conclusion<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In accord with their wishes, and home again they go.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And thereupon he to his officers<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Commands the feast to prepare,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And to his household knights and squires<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Gave such orders as he desired to lay on them;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And they to his commandment obey,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And each of them does all his efforts<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To lend honor unto the feast.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Not far from that same noble palace,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Where this marquis planned his marriage,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There stood a small village, in a delightful location,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In which poor folk of that village<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Had their beasts and their dwellings<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And of their labor took their sustenance,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; According to what produce the earth gave them.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Among these poor folk there dwelt a man<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who was considered poorest of them all;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But high God sometimes can send <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His grace into a little ox's stall;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Janicula men of that village call him.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A daughter had he, fair enough in appearance,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And Griselda this young maiden was called.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But to speak of virtuous beauty,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Then was she the fairest of all under sun;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Because she was raised in poverty,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; No sensual desire had run through her heart.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Much more often of the well than of the wine barrel<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She drank, and because she would satisfy the demands of virtue<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She knew well labor but no idle ease.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But though this maid was tender of age,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Yet in the breast of her virginity<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There was enclosed a mature and steadfast spirit;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And in great reverence and charity<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Her old poor father she cared for.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A few sheep, while spinning, on field she kept;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She would not be idle until she slept.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And when she homeward came, she would bring<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Cabbages or other greens very often,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Which she shredded and boiled for their sustenance<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And made her bed full hard and not at all soft;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And ever she sustained her father's life<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With every obedience and diligence<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That child may do to father's reverence.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Upon Griselda, this poor creature,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Very many times this marquis set his eye<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; By chance, as he on hunting rode;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And when it happened that he might see her,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He not with lecherous looking of folly<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His eyes cast on hire, but in serious manner<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Upon her demeanor he would often think,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Commending in his heart her womanly qualities,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And also her virtue, passing any person<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of so young age, as well in manner as deed.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For though the people have no great insight<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In virtue, he considered very carefully<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Her goodness, and decided that he would<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Wed her only, if ever he should wed.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The day of wedding came, but no person can<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Tell what woman it should be;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For which marvel wondered many a man,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And said, when they were in private,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Will not our lord yet leave his vanity?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Will he not wed? Alas! Alas, the times!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Why will he thus himself and us deceive?"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But nevertheless this marquis has made<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of gems, set in gold and in azure,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Brooches and rings, for Griselda's sake;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And of her clothing he took the measure<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; By a maid like her (in) stature,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And also of all other ornaments<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That unto such a wedding should be appropriate.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The time of mid-morning of the same day<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Approaches, when this wedding should be,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And all the palace was put in proper order,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Both hall and chambers, each in its turn;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Storage buildings stuffed with plenty,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There canst thou see, of delicious foods<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What can be found from as far as farthest Italy.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This royal marquis, richly arrayed,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Lords and ladies in his company,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who were invited to the feast, <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And of his retinue the knights,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With many a sound of varied melody,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Unto the village of which I told<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In this splendid array the direct route have held.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Griselda of this, God knows, full ignorant,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That for her was all this splendour prepared,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Has gone to fetch water at a well,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And comes home as soon as ever she can;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For well she had heard said that same day<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The marquis should wed, and if she could,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She would be happy to have seen some of that sight.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She thought, "I will stand with other maidens,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who are my fellows, in our door and see<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The marchioness, and therefore will I try<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To do at home, as soon as it can be,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The chores that I must do,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And then I may at leisure her behold,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If she takes this way to the castle."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And as she would over her threshold go,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The marquis came and called her;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And she set down her water pot quickly,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Beside the threshold, in an ox's stall,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And down upon her knees she fell,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And with sober countenance kneels without speaking,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Until she had heard what was the lord's will.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This pensive marquis spoke unto this maid<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Full soberly, and said in this manner:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Where is your father, O Griselda?" he said.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And she with reverence, in humble manner,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Answered, "Lord, he is right here."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And in she goes without longer delay,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And to the marquis she fetched her father.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He by the hand then took this old man,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And said thus, when he had him aside:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Janicula, I neither may nor can<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Longer hide the desire of my heart.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If thou agree, whatsoever may happen,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thy daughter will I take, before I depart,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For my wife, until her life's end.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Thou lovest me, I know it well for certain,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And art my faithful liege man born,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And all that pleases me, I dare well say<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It pleases thee, and specially therefore<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Tell me of that question that I have stated previously,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If thou will agree with that proposal,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To take me for thy son-in-law."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This sudden occurrence this man so astounded <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That he grew red; abashed and all trembling<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He stood; hardly said he any more words,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But only thus: "Lord," said he, "my desire<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Is as you wish, and against your pleasure<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I will do nothing, you are my lord so dear;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Right as you please, govern this matter."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Yet I want," said this marquis softly,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "That in thy chamber I and thou and she<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Have a discussion, and knowest thou why?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For I will ask if it be her will <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To be my wife and conduct herself as I decide.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And all this shall be done in thy presence;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I will say nothing out of thy hearing."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And in the chamber, while they were engaged in<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Their negotiation, which you shall after hear,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The people came unto outside the house,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And wondered in what a virtuous manner<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And how attentively she cared for her dear father.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But certainly Griselda might wonder,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For never before saw she such a sight.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Though it is no wonder that she was astonished<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To see so great a guest come in that place;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She never was accustomed to such guests,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For which she looked full pale in her face.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But shortly forth this matter to pursue,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; These are the words that the marquis said<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To this benign, true, faithful maid:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Griselda," he said, "you shall well understand<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It is pleasing to your father and to me<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That I you wed, and also it may so stand,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As I suppose, that you desire that it so be.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But these questions ask I first," said he,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "That, since it shall be done in a hasty manner,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Will you assent, or else think it over?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "I say this: are you ready (to submit) with good heart<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To all my desires, and that I freely may,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As seems best to me, make you laugh or feel pain,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And you never to grouch about it, at any time?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And also when I say `yes,' say not `nay,'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Neither by word nor frowning countenance?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Swear this, and here I swear our alliance."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Wondering upon these words, trembling for fear,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She said, "Lord, unsuitable and unworthy<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Am I of that same honor that you offer me,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But as you desire yourself, right so desire I.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And here I swear that never willingly,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In deed nor thought, will I disobey you,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Even to be dead, though I would hate to die."	
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "This is enough, Griselda mine," said he.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And forth he goes with a full sober manner<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Out of the door, and after that came she,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And to the people he said in this manner:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "This is my wife," said he, "that stands here.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Honor her and love her, I pray,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Whoever loves me; there is no more to say."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And so that nothing of her old belongings<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She should bring into his house, he ordered<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That women should undress her right there;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of which these ladies were not very happy<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To handle her clothes, in which she was clad.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But nevertheless, this maid bright of hue<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; From foot to head they have clothed all new.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Her hair have they combed, that lay unkempt<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Very crudely, and with their elegant fingers<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A crown on her head they have placed,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And set her garments full of jeweled ornaments of every sort.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of her appearance why should I make a long tale?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The hardly people knew her for her beauty<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When she was translated into such riches.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This marquis has espoused her with a ring<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Brought for the same purpose, and then set her <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Upon a horse, snow-white and with a gentle pace,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And to his palace, before he longer delayed,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With joyful people that led and met her,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Conducted her; and thus the day they spend<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In revel, until the sun descended.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And shortly forth this tale to pursue,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I say that to this new marchioness <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; God has such favor sent her of his grace<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That it seemed not likely<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That she was born and fed in humble circumstances,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In a peasant's hut or in an ox-stall,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But nurtured in an emperor's hall.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To every person she is grown so dear<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And worshipful that folk where she was born,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And from her birth knew her year by year,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They hardly believed -- but dared have sworn --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That to Janicle, of whom I spoke before,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She was daughter, for, by conjecture,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They thought she was another creature.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For though that she was always virtuous,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She was increased in such excellence<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of good characteristics, set in high goodness,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And so discreet and fair of eloquence,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So benign and so worthy of reverence,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And could so the people's heart embrace,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That each who looked on her face loved her.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Not only in the town of Saluces <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Was made known the praise of her name,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But also moreover in many a region,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If one said well, another said the same;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So spread the fame of her high goodness <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That men and women, as well young as old,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Go to Saluce to look upon her.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thus Walter lowly -- nay, but royally --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Wedded with beneficial virtue,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In God's peace lives full easily<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; At home, and to all appearances he had sufficient happiness;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And because he saw that under low social rank<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Was often virtue hid, the people considered him<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A prudent man, and that is seen full seldom.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Not only this Griselda through her wit<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Knew all the skills of a housewife's duties,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But also, when the situation required it,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The public good could she promote.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There was no discord, rancor, nor sadness <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In all that land that she could not alleviate,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And wisely bring them all in rest and ease.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Though her husband was absent at the time,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If noble men or others of her country<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Were wroth, she would bring them to agreement;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Such wise and well considered words had she,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And judgments of such great justice,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That she was sent from heaven, as men supposed,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; People to save and every wrong to amend.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Not long time after this Griselda<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Was married, she has borne a daughter,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Although she would rather have given birth to a male child;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Glad was this marquis and the folk for this,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For though a maid child came all before,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She may unto a male child attain<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; By likelihood, since she is not barren.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There happened, as it befalls many times,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When this child had suckled but a short time,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This marquis in his heart longs so<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To test his wife, her constancy to know,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That he could not out of his heart throw<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This strange desire to test his wife;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Needless, God knows, he intended to frighten her.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He had tested her enough before,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And found her always good; why was it needed<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To test her, and always more and more,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Though some men praise its ingenuity?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But as for me, I say that it ill befits one<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To test a wife when there is no need,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And put her in anguish and in dread.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For which this marquis worked in this manner:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He came alone at night, where she lay,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With stern face and with a very troubled manner,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And said thus: "Griselda," said he, "that day<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That I took you out of your impoverished situation,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And put you in the condition of high nobility --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You have not forgotten that, as I suppose?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "I say, Griselda, this present high social position,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In which I have put you, as I believe,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Requires that you be not forgetful <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That I took you in a poor, very humble condition,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Despite any present prosperity you must know it yourself. <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Take heed of every word that I say to you;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There is no person that hears it but we two.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "You know well yourself how you came here<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Into this house, it is not long ago;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And though to me you are beloved and dear,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Unto my nobles you are not at all so.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They say, to them it is great shame and woe<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To be subjects and be in servitude<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To thee, that art born in a humble village.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "And especially since thy daughter was born<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; These words have they spoken, doubtless.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But I desire, as I have done before,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To live my life with them in rest and peace.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I can not be imprudent in this case;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I must do with thy daughter for the best,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Not as I would want, but as my people desire.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "And yet, God knows, this is full hateful to me;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But nevertheless without your knowledge<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I will not do anything; but this I desire," said he,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "That you assent to me in this matter.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Show now in your actions your patience, <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That you promised me and swore in your village<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That day that our marriage was made."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When she had heard all this, she changed not <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Neither in word, nor manner, nor countenance,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For, as it seemed, she was not aggrieved.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She said, "Lord, all is subject to your pleasure.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; My child and I, with heart-felt obedience,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Are entirely yours, and you may save or kill<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Your own thing; do as you will.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "There can nothing, as God my soul may save,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Please you that may displease me;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Nor do I desire to have anything,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Nor dread to lose, save only you.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This will is in my heart, and ever shall be;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; No length of time or death can obliterate this,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Nor change my heart to another place."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Glad was this marquis of her answer,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But yet he feigned as if he were not so;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; All sorrowful was his manner and his look,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When he had to go out of the chamber.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Soon after this, in a few minutes,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He privately has told all his plan<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Unto a man, and sent him to his wife.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A sort of sergeant (policeman) was this confidential servant,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Whom he had often found faithful <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In important matters, and also such folk well can<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Carry out their orders in evil matters.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The lord knew well that he loved and dreaded him;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And when this sergeant knew his lord's will,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Into the chamber he stalked very quietly.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Madame," he said, "you must forgive it me,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Though I do a thing to which I am constrained.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You are so wise that full well you know<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That lords' commands may not be evaded (by feigning);<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They may well be bewailed or complained of,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But men must by necessity unto their desires obey,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And so will I; there is no more to say.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "This child I am commanded to take" --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And spoke no more, but out the child he seized<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Mercilessly, and made a face<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As if he would have slain it before he went.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Griselda must suffer all and consent to all,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And as a lamb she sits meek and still,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And let this cruel sergeant do his will.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Suspicious was the bad reputation of this man,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Suspect his face, suspect his word also;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Suspect the time in which he this began.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Alas! Her daughter that she loved so,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She thought he would have slain it right then.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But nevertheless she neither wept nor sighed,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Conforming herself to what the marquis pleased.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But at the last she began to speak,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And meekly she to the sergeant prayed,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As he was a worthy gentle man,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That she might kiss her child before it died.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And in her lap this little child she laid<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With full sad face, and blessed the child,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And lulled it, and afterward kissed it.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And thus she said in her benign voice,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Farewell my child! I shall thee never see.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But since I have marked thee with the cross<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of that same Father -- blessed may he be! --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That for us died upon a cross of wood,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thy soul, little child, I entrust to him,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For this night shalt thou die for my sake."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I believe that to a nurse in this case<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It would have been hard this pitiful situation to see;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Well might a mother then have cried "alas!"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But nevertheless so firmly steadfast was she<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That she endured all adversity,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And to the sergeant meekly she said,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Have here again your little young maid.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Go now," said she, "and do my lord's command;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But one thing will I pray you of your grace,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That, unless my lord forbad you, at the least<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Bury this little body in some place<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That no beasts nor birds tear it to pieces."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But he no word will say to that proposal,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But took the child and went upon his way.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This sergeant came unto his lord again,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And of Griselda's words and her manner<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He told him in detail, in short and plain (words),<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And presents him with his daughter dear.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Somewhat this lord had pity in his manner,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But nevertheless his purpose held he still,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As lords do, when they will have their will;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And commanded this sergeant that he secretly<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Should this child softly wind and wrap (in a blanket),<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With every care tenderly,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And carry it in a box or in a folded cloth;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But, upon pain of having his head cut off,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; No man should know of his intention,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Nor whence he came, nor whither he went;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But at Bologna to his sister dear,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who at that very time was countess of Panik,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He should take it and explain to her this matter,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Beseeching her to do her best<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This child to nurture in all noble manners;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And whose child that it was he commanded her to hide<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; From every person, for anything that may happen.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The sergeant goes, and has fulfilled this order;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But to this marquis we now return.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For now he goes very intently considering<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If by his wife's appearance he might see,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or by her word perceive, if she<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Were changed; but he never could find her <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Anything but always the same, alike steadfast and kind.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As glad, as humble, as diligent in service,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And also in love, as she was accustomed to be,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Was she to him in every sort of way;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Nor of her daughter not a word spoke she.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; No external sign, for any adversity,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Was seen in her, and never her daughter's name<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Mentioned she, in earnest nor in jest (in any way).<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In this condition there are passed four years<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Before she was with child, but, as God would,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A male child she bore by this Walter,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Very gracious and beautiful in appearance.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And when folk told it to his father,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Not only he but all his country merry<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Was for this child, and God they thank and praise.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When it was two years old, and from the breast<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of his nurse weaned, on one day<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This marquis caught yet another desire<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To test his wife yet again, if he can.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; O needless was she put to the test!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But wedded men know no moderation,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When they find a patient creature.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Wife," said this marquis, "you have heard before this<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; My people are unhappy with our marriage;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And especially since my son is born,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Now is it worse than ever in all our lives.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The grumbling slays my heart and my feelings,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For to my ears comes the voice so sharply<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That it well nigh has destroyed my heart.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Now say they thus: `When Walter is gone,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Then shall the blood of Janicle succeed<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And be our lord, for we have no other.'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Such words say my people, no doubt.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Well ought I of such grumbling take heed,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For certainly I dread such opinion,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Though they speak not plainly in my hearing.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "I would live in peace, if I could; <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Therefore I am firmly resolved, <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As I dealt with his sister by night,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Right so I intend to deal with him secretly.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This I warn you, so that you not suddenly<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For any woe should break out in a passion;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Be patient, and for that I pray you."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "I have," said she, "said thus, and ever shall:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I want nothing, nor will not want any thing, certainly,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But as you desire. It does not grieve me at all,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Though my daughter and my son be slain --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; At your commandment, this is to say.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I have not had any part of children two<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But first sickness, and after, woe and pain.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "You are our lord; do with your own thing<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Right as you desire; ask no advice from me.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For as I left at home all my clothing,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When I first came to you, right so," said she,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Left I my will and all my liberty,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And took your clothing; wherefore I you pray,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Do your pleasure; I will obey your desire.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "And certainly, if I had foreknowledge<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To know your will, before you told me your desire,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I would do it without negligence;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But now I know your desire, and what you want,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; All your pleasure (whatever you wish) firm and stable I hold;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For if I knew that my death would do you ease,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Right gladly would I die, to please you.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Death can not make any comparison (is nothing compared)<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Unto your love." And when this marquis saw<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The constancy of his wife, he cast down<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His eyes two, and wonders that she can<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In patience suffer all this treatment;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And forth he goes with sorrowful countenance,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But to his heart it was full great pleasure.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This ugly sergeant, in the same manner<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That he her daughter seized, right so he --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or worse, if one can worse imagine --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Has seized her son, that was full of beauty.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And continually so patient was she<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That she made no appearance of sadness,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But kissed her son, and afterwards it blessed;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Save this, she prayed him that, if he could,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Her little son he would bury in earth<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His tender limbs, pleasing in appearance,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; From birds and from beasts to save.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But she no answer of him might have.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He went his way, as if he cared nothing about it,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But to Bologna he tenderly brought it.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This marquis wondered, more and more,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Upon her patience, and if he<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Had not truly known before this<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That she perfectly loved her children,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He would have supposed that by some trickery,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And out of malice, or for hard heart,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That she had suffered this with calm manner.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But well he knew that next to himself, certainly,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She loved her children best in every way.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But now I would like to ask of women <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If these tests might not suffice?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What could a cruel husband more devise<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To test her wifehood and her steadfastness,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And he continuing ever in cruelty?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But there are folk of such disposition<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That when they have a certain purpose taken,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They can not refrain from their intention,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But, right as if they were bound to that stake,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They will not from that original plan desist.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Right so this marquis has firmly decided<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To test his wife as he was first disposed.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He watches to see if by word or countenance<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That she to him was changed in heart,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But never could he find variation.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She was always the same in heart and in visage,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And ever the further that she was in age,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The more true, if it were possible,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She was to him in love, and more attentive.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For which it seemed thus: that of them two<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There was but one will, for as Walter desired,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The same desire was her pleasure also.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And, God be thanked, all fell for the best.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She proved good; for no worldly discomfort<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A wife, concerning herself, nothing should<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Desire in fact, except what her husband would want.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The ill fame of Walter spread often and wide,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That of a cruel heart he wickedly,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Because he had wedded a poor woman,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Has murdered both his children secretly.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Such grumbling was among them unanimously.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; No wonder is, for to the people's ear<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There came no word but that they were murdered.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For which, whereas his people before this<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Had loved him well, the disgrace of his bad reputation<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Made them so that they hated him for this.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To be a murderer is (to have) a hateful reputation;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But nevertheless, not for any reason,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Would he of his cruel purpose desist;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To test his wife was set all his intention.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When his daughter was twelve years of age,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He to the court of Rome, (which was) in a cunning manner<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Informed of his real purpose, sent his messenger,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Commanding them such papal bulls to devise<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As to his cruel purpose may suffice --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; How the pope, to restore tranquility for his people,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Commanded him to wed another, if he pleased.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I say, he commanded they should counterfeit<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The pope's bulls, making mention<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That he has permission to leave his first wife,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As by the pope's dispensation,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To stint rancor and dissension<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Between his people and him; thus said the bull,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Which they have published widely.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The ignorant people, as it no wonder is,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Supposed full well that it had been right so;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But when these tidings came to Griselda,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I believe that her heart was very woeful.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But she, continuously steadfast for evermore,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Disposed was, this humble creature,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To endure all the adversity of Fortune,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Enduring ever his desire and his pleasure,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To whom she was given, heart and all,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As her true worldly source of satisfaction.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But shortly if this story I tell shall,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This marquis written has in detail<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A letter, in which he reveals his intention,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And secretly he sent it to Bologna.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To the Earl of Panyk, who had then<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Wedded his sister, prayed he specifically<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To bring home again his two children<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In a noble public display.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But one thing he him prayed earnestly,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That he to no one, though men would inquire,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Should tell whose children they were,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But say the maiden should wedded be<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Unto the Marquis of Saluce immediately.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And as this earl was asked, so did he;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For at the set day he on his way is gone<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Toward Saluce, and lords many a one<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In rich array, this maiden to guide,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Her young brother riding beside her.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Adorned was in preparation for her marriage<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This lovely maid, (her clothing) full of bright gems;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Her brother, who was seven years of age,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Adorned also full handsomely in his manner.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And thus in great nobility and with a glad manner,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Toward Saluces directing their journey,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; From day to day they ride on their way.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Meanwhile, in accord with his wicked usage,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This marquis, yet his wife to test more<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To the utmost test of her heart,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Fully to have experience and knowledge<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If she were as steadfast as before,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He on a certain day in the hearing of all<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Full rudely has said to her this speech:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Certainly, Griselda, I had enough pleasure<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To have you as my wife for your goodness,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As for your truth and for your obedience<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Not for your lineage, nor for your riches;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But now know I in true certainty<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That in great lordship, if I judge rightly,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There is great servitude in various ways.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "I can not do as every plowman may.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; My people constrain me to take<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Another wife, and complain day by day;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And also the pope, to quench rancor, <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Consents to it -- that dare I assert --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And truly thus much I will say to you:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; My new wife is coming by the way.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Be strong of heart, and vacate her place immediately;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And that dowry that you brought me,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Take it back; I grant it of my grace.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Return to your father's house," said he;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "No one can always have prosperity.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With tranquil heart I advise you to endure<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The stroke of Fortune or of chance."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And she in reply answered in patience:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "My lord," said she, "I know, and knew always,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; How between your magnificence<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And my poverty no person can nor may<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Make comparison; it cannot be denied.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I considered myself never worthy in any way<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To be your wife, no, nor your chambermaid.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "And in this house, where you made me the lady --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The high God I take for my witness,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And as surely as he my soul may gladden --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I never considered myself lady nor mistress,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But humble servant to your worthiness,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And ever shall, while my life may endure,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Above every worldly creature.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "That you so long of your benignity<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Have maintained me in honor and nobility,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Where I was not worthy to be,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For that I thank you and God, to Whom I pray<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To reward you for it; there is no more to say.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Unto my father gladly will I go,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And with him dwell unto my life's end.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Where I was fostered as a child full small,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Until I be dead I will lead my life there,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A widow clean in body, heart, and all.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For since I gave to you my maidenhead,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And am your true wife, there is no doubt,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; God forbid such a lord's wife to take<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Another man as husband or as mate!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "And of your new wife God of his grace<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Grant you happiness and prosperity!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For I will gladly yield her my place,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In which I was accustomed to be blissful.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For since it pleases you, my lord," said she,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Who once was all my heart's peace,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That I shall go, I will go when you please.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "But inasmuch as you offer me such dowry<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As I first brought, it is well in my mind<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It was my wretched clothing, in no way fair,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Which to me were hard to find now.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; O good God! How gentle and how kind<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You seemed by your speech and your visage<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The day that our marriage was made!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "But sooth is said -- always I find it true,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For in fact it is proven by me --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When love is old it is not the same as when it was new.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But certainly, lord, for no adversity,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Even if I were to die miserably, it shall not be<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That ever in word or deed I shall repent<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That I gave you my heart whole heartedly.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "My lord, you know that in my father's place<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You had me stripped out of my poor clothing,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And had me richly clad, by your grace.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To you I brought nothing else, beyond doubt,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But faith, and nakedness, and maidenhead;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And here in return your clothing I restore,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And also your wedding ring, for evermore.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "The remnant of your jewels ready are<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Within your chamber, dare I confidently say.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Naked out of my father's house," said she,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "I came, and naked must I return.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; All your pleasure will I eagerly follow;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But yet I hope it be not your intention<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That I should go without a smock out of your palace.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "You could not do so shameful a thing,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That that same womb in which your children lay<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Should before the people, in my walking,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Be seen all bare; therefore I you pray,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Let me not like a worm go by the way.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Remember, my own lord so dear,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I was your wife, though I unworthy were.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Therefore, in recompense for my maidenhead,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Which I brought, and nothing I bear back,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Condescend to give me, as my recompense,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Only such a smock as I was accustomed to wear,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That I with it may cover the womb of her<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who was your wife. And here take I my leave<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of you, my own lord, lest I you grieve."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "The smock," said he, "that thou hast on thy back,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Let it be (there) still, and bear it forth with thee."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But scarcely that same word he spoke,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But went his way, for grief and for pity.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Before the folk she strips herself,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And in her smock, with head and foot all bare,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Toward her father's house forth is she gone.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The folk follow her, weeping on their way,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And Fortune ever they curse as they go;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But she from weeping kept her eyes dry,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And in this time no word she spoke.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Her father, who heard this news straightway,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Curses the day and time that Nature<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Shaped him to be a living creature.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For doubtless this old poor man<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Was ever in suspicion of her marriage;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For ever he believed, since it began,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That when the lord had fulfilled his desires,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He would think it was a degradation<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To his rank so low to stoop,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And get rid of her as soon as ever he could.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To meet his daughter hastily goes he,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For he by noise of folk knew her coming,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And with her old coat, insofar as it could<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He covered her, full sorrowfully weeping.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But on her body he could not bring it,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For coarse was the cloth, and more of age<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; By many days than at her marriage.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thus with her father for a certain space of time<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Dwells this flower of womanly patience,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That neither by her words nor her face,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Before the folk, nor also in their absence,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She showed that to her was done offence;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Nor of her high estate no remembrance<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Had she, according to her countenance.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; No wonder is, for in her great estate<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Her spirit was ever in full humility;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; No tender mouth, no self-indulgent feelings,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; No pomp, nor outward appearance of royalty,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But full of patient goodness,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Discreet and without pride, ever honorable,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And to her husband ever meek and stable.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Men speak of Job, and mostly for his humility,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As clerks, when they want, know well how to write,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Especially of men, but in truth,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Though clerks praise women but a little,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There can no man in humility acquit himself<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As woman can, nor can be half so true<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As women are, unless it happened recently.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; From Bologna is this Earl of Panyk come,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of which the news up sprang to high ranks and low,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And to the people's ears, one and all,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Was made known also that a new marchioness <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He brought with him, in such pomp and riches<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That never was there seen with man's eye<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Such a noble array in all West Lombardy.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The marquis, who arranged and knew all this,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Before this earl was come, sent his messenger<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For that same innocent poor Griselda;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And she with humble heart and glad visage,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Not with any proud thought in her heart,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Came at his command, and on her knees set herself,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And reverently and wisely she greeted him.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Griselda," said he, "my will is completely<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That this maiden, who shall be wedded to me,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Be received to-morrow as royally<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As it is possible in my house to be,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And also that every person, according to his rank<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Have his due respect, in seating and service<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And great pleasure, as I can best arrange.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "I have no women capable, certainly,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The chambers to put in order<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; According to my wishes, and therefore I would like<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That thine be the supervision of all this business.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thou knowest also of old all my desires;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Though thy dress be bad and in poor condition,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Do thou thy duty at least."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Not only, lord, I am glad," said she,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "To do your wishes, but I desire also<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You to serve and please in accord with my rank<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Without weakening, and shall evermore;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Nor never, for any happiness nor any woe,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Shall the spirit within my heart cease<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To love you best with all my true will."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And with that word she began to prepare the house,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And to set tables, and make beds;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And took pains to do all that she could,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Praying the chambermaids, for God's sake,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To hasten themselves, and fast sweep and dust;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And she, the most willing to serve of all,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Has every chamber prepared and his hall.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; About mid-morning did this earl alight,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who with him brought these noble children two,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For which the people ran to see the sight<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of their accoutrements, so rich in appearance;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And then for the first time amongst themselves they say<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That Walter was no fool, though he desired<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To change his wife, for it was for the best.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For she is fairer, as they all decide,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Than is Griselda, and more tender of age,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And fairer fruit between them should fall,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And more pleasing, because of her high lineage.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Her brother also so fair was of visage<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That the people take pleasure in seeing them,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Commending now the marquis's governance.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "O stormy people! Inconstant and ever untrue!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Ever undiscerning and changing like a weather vane!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Delighting ever in rumor that is new,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For like the moon ever you wax and wane!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Always full of chattering, not worth a penny!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Your judgment is false, your constancy proves evil;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A full great fool is he that believes in you."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thus said serious folk in that city,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When the people gazed up and down,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For they were glad, right for the novelty,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To have a new lady of their town.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; No more of this make I now mention,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But to Griselda again will I address myself,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And tell her constancy and her diligence.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Full busy was Griselda in every thing<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That was pertaining to the feast.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Not at all was she ashamed of her clothing,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Though it was crude and also somewhat ragged;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But with glad manner to the gate is went<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With other folk to greet the marchioness,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And after that carries on her work.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With such glad manner his guests she receives,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And so skillfully, each according to his rank,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That no man perceives any fault,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But ever they wonder who she might be<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That in such poor array was to be seen,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And knew how to do such honor and reverence,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And deservedly they praise her prudence.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In all this mean while she did not cease<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This maid and also her brother to commend<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With all her heart, in full benign intention,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So well that no man could praise her more highly.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But at the last, when these lords went<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To sit down to dinner, he called<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Griselda, as she was busy in his hall.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Griselda," said he, as if it were a joke,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "How do you like my wife and her beauty?"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Right well," said she, "my lord; for, in good faith,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I never saw so fair a one as she.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I pray to God to give her prosperity;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And so I hope that he will to you send<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Pleasure enough unto your lives' end.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "One thing I beseech you, and warn also,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That you not distress with any tormenting<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This tender maiden, as you have done to others;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For she has been reared in her nurture<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; More tenderly, and, as I believe,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She could not endure adversity <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As could a poorly reared creature."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And when this Walter saw her patience,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Her glad expression, and no malice at all,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And he so often had done to her offence,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And she ever steadfast and constant as a wall,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Continuing ever her innocence in every way,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This stern marquis inclined his heart<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To have pity upon her womanly steadfastness.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "This is enough, Griselda mine," said he;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Be now no more frightened nor displeased.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I have thy faith and thy goodness,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As well as ever woman was, tested,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In great estate and in poverty.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Now I know, dear wife, thy steadfastness" --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And took her in arms and kissed her.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And she for amazement took of it no notice;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She heard not what thing he said to her;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She fared as if she had suddenly awakened out of a sleep,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Until out of her bewilderment she suddenly awoke.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Griselda," said he, "by God, who for us died,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thou art my wife, and none other I have,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Nor ever had, as God my soul may save!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "This is thy daughter, which thou hast supposed<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To be my wife; that other truly<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Shall be my heir, as I have ever intended;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thou bore him in thy body truly.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; At Bologna I have kept them secretly;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Take them back, for now mayst thou not say<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That thou hast lost any of thy children two.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "And folk that otherwise have said of me,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I declare to them clearly that I have done this deed<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For no malice, nor for no cruelty,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But to test in thee thy womanhood,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And not to slay my children -- God forbid! --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But to keep them secretly and quietly,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Until I knew thy perseverence and all thy will."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When she heard this, down she falls in a swoon<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For pitiful joy, and after her swooning<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She calls both her young children to her,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And in her arms, pitifully weeping,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Embraces them, and tenderly kissing<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Full like a mother, with her salt tears<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She bathed both their visage and their hair.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; O what a pathetic thing it was to see<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Her swooning, and her humble voice to hear!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Great thanks, lord, may God repay it to you," said she,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "That you have saved for me my children dear!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Now care I never to be dead right here;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Since I stand in your love and in your grace,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Death does not matter, nor when my spirit may pass (away)!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "O tender, o dear, o my young children!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Your woeful mother truly believed <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That cruel hounds or some foul animal pests<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Had eaten you; but God of his mercy<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And your benign father tenderly<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Has had you protected" -- and in that same moment<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; All suddenly she fell down to the ground.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And in her swoon so tightly holds she<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Her children two, when she embraced them,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That with great effort and great difficulty<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The children from her arm they did tear away.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; O many a tear on many a pitiful face<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Down ran of them that stood beside her;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Hardly about her might they remain.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Walter comforts her and her sorrow relieves;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She rises up, disconcerted, from her trance,	<b><BR></b>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And every person makes joy and festivity for her<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Until she has regained her composure.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Walter strives so faithfully to please her<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That it was delightful to see the happiness<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Between them two, now they are met together.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; These ladies, when they see their time,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Have taken her and into chamber they go,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And strip her out of her crude clothing,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And in a cloth of gold that brightly shone,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With a crown of many a rich stone<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Upon her head, they into hall her brought,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And there she was honored as she deserved.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thus has this pitiful day a blissful end,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For every man and woman does his might<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This day in mirth and revel to spend<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Until in the sky shone the stars' light.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For more splendid in every man's sight<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This feast was, and greater of cost,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Than was the revel of their marriage.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Full many a year in high prosperity<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Live these two in peace and in quiet,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And richly his daughter married he<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Unto a lord, one of the worthiest<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of all Italy; and then in peace and rest<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His wife's father in his court he keeps,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Until the soul out of his body creeps.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His son succeeds in his heritage<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In rest and peace, after his father's day,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And fortunate was also in marriage,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Although he put not his wife in great tests.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This world is not so strong, there is no denying,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As it has been in old times long ago,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And listen to what this author says concerning this (tale).<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This story is said not so that wives should<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Follow Griselda in humility,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For it would be intolerable, though they would (want to),<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But so that every person, in his station in life,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Should be constant in adversity<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As was Griselda; therefore Petrarch writes<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This story, which with high style he composes.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For since a woman was so patient<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Unto a mortal man, well more we ought to<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Receive with a good will all that God sends us;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For it is very reasonable that he test what he made.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But he tests no man that he redeemed,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As says Saint James, if you his epistle read;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He tests folk all the time, it is no doubt,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And permits us, for our own good<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With sharp whips of adversity<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Full often to be beaten in various ways;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Not to know our will, for certainly he,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Before we were born, knew all our frailty;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And for our best is all his governance.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Let us then live in virtuous forbearance.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But one word, lords, hear before I go:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It would be very difficult to find now-a-days<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In all the town Griseldas three or two;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For if they were put to such tests,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The gold of them has now been so badly debased<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With brass, that though the coin be fair to look at,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It would rather break in two than bend.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For which here, for the love of the Wife of Bath --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Whose life and all her sect may God maintain<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In high mastery, and otherwise it would be a pity --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I will with lusty heart, fresh and vigorous,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Say you a song to make you happy, I believe;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And let us stint of serious matter.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Hear my song that says in this manner:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Griselda is dead, and also her patience,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And both together buried in Italy;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For which I cry in the hearing of all<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; No wedded man so bold be to test<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His wife's patience trusting to find<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Griselda, for certainly he shall faille.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; O noble wives, full of great prudence,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Let no humility nail down your tongue,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Nor let any clerk have cause or eagerness<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To write about you a story of such marvel<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As of patient and kind Griselda,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Lest Chichevache swallow you in her entrails!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Follow Echo, who holds no silence,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But ever answers in reply.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Be not fooled because of your innocence,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But eagerly take the governance to yourself.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Imprint well this lesson in your mind,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Since it may work to the benefit of all.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You arch-wives, stand ready for battle,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Since you are strong as is a great camel;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Suffer not that men do offense to you.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And slender wives, feeble in battle,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Be fierce as is a tiger yonder in India;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Ever wag your tongues like a windmill, I you advise.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Fear them not; do them no reverence,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For though thy husband be armed in mail,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The arrows of thy spiteful eloquence<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Shall pierce his breast and also his neck-guard.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In jealousy I advise also that thou bind him,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And thou shalt make him cower as does a quail.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If thou be fair, where folk are present,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Show thou thy visage and thy apparel;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If thou be ugly, be lavish in thy expenditures;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To get thee friends always work hard;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Be ever in behavior as light as a leaf on a linden tree,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And let him grieve, and weep, and wring his hands, and wail!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; [When ended was the tale of this worthy Clerk,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Our Host said, and swore, "By God's bones,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I would rather than have a barrel of ale<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; My wife at home had heard this legend once!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This is a fine tale for this occasion,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For my purposes, if you knew my will;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But thing that will not be, let it be still."]<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A merchant once dwelled at Seint-Denis, <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who was rich, for which men considered him wise.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He had a wife of excellent beauty;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And she was sociable and fond of revelry, <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which is a thing that causes more expense<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than is worth all the good cheer and reverence <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That men do to them at festivities and at dances. <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such salutations and courtesies<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pass away as does a shadow upon the wall;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But woe to him that must pay for all!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The poor (hapless) husband, always he must pay, <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He must clothe us, and he must adorn us<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richly, all for the sake of his own reputation,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In which finery we dance merrily.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And if it happens he can not pay, <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or else desires to endure no such expense,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But thinks it is wasted and lost,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then another must pay for our costs,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or lend us gold, and that is perilous.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This noble merchant held a worthy house,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For which he always had so many guests<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of his generosity, and because his wife was fair, <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That it is a wonder; but listen to my tale.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among all his guests, high ranking and low,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a monk, a handsome man and a bold one --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe he was about thirty years old --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who continually was drawing to that place.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This young monk, who had so handsome a face,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was so acquainted with the good man,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since their first acquaintance began,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That in his house as intimate was he <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As it is possible for any friend to be.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in view of the fact that this good man,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And also this monk of whom I began (to tell),<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two of them, were both born in one village, <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The monk claims him as a kinsman,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he does the same; he not once says 'nay,'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But was as glad of this as a fowl is of day,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For to his heart it was a great pleasure.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus are they knit with eternal alliance,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And each of them assured the other <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of brotherhood while their life may endure.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Free-handed was Don John, and generous in spending<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that house, and full of diligence<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To do pleasure, and also great expenditure. <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not forget to give to the lowest ranking servant<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In all that house; but according to their rank, <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He gave to the lord, and then to all his household, <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he came, some sort of suitable gift,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For which they were as glad of his coming<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a fowl is happy when the sun rises up.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No more of this for now, for it suffices.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But as it happened, this merchant on a day<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Decided to make ready his preparations<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To travel to the town of Bruges ,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To buy there a quantity of merchandise;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For which he has to Paris sent immediately<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A messenger, and has prayed Don John<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That he should come to Seint-Denis to visit<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With him and with his wife a day or two,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before he went to Bruges, indeed.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This noble monk, of whom I tell you,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has of his abbot, as he pleases, permission, <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because he was a man of great prudence<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And also an officer, to ride out<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To see to their granges and their capacious barns,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he comes quickly to Seint-Denis.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who was so welcome as my lord Don John,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our dear cousin, full of courtesy?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With him he brought a jug of malmsey wine, <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And also another full of fine white wine,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And game fowls, as always was his custom.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And thus I let them eat and drink and amuse themselves,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This merchant and this monk, for a day or two.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third day, this merchant up arises,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And seriously considers his business,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he goes up into his counting-house<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To reckon with himself, as it well may be,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of that same year how it stood with him,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And how he had spent his funds,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And if he had profited or not.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His account books and his moneybags many a one<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He lays before him on his counting-board.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His treasure and his hoard was very rich,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For which he very tightly shut his counting house-door;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And also he wanted that no one should hinder him<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From (making) his accounts, for the time being;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And thus he sits until it was past nine o'clock.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don John had also risen in the morning,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in the garden walks to and fro,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And has said his prayers very courteously.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This good wife came walking alone <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the garden, where he walks quietly,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And salutes him, as she has often done.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A maid servant came in her company,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whom she may govern and guide as she pleases,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the maid was yet subject to adult discipline.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh my dear cousin, Don John," she said,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What ails you to rise so early?"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Niece," said he, "it ought enough suffice<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To sleep five hours upon a night,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless it were for an old enfeebled creature, <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As are these wedded men, that lie and doze<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As in his lair sits a weary hare,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which is greatly distressed by hounds great and small.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But dear niece, why are you so pale?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe, certainly, that the head of our household<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has labored you since the night began<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So much that you badly have need to rest."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And with that word he laughed very merrily,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And of his own thought he grew all red.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This fair wife began to shake her head<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And said thus, "Yea, God knows all," she said.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nay, my cousin, it stands not so with me;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For, by that God that gave me soul and life,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In all the realm of France there is no wife<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That has less desire for that sorry play.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For I may sing `alas and alack<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That I was born,' but to no one," she said,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dare I tell how it stands with me.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore I intend to go out of this land,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or else to make an end of myself,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am so full of dread and also of care."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This monk began to stare upon this wife,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And said, "Alas, my niece, God forbid<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That you, for any sorrow or any dread,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should destroy yourself; but tell me your grief.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps I can, in your unhappy situation,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Advise or help; and therefore tell me<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All your trouble, for it shall be secret.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For on my prayer book I make an oath<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That never in my life, willing or unwilling,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall I betray any of your secrets."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The same in reply to you," she said, "I say.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By God and by this prayer book I swear,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though men would tear me all to pieces<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall never, even though I go to hell for it,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Betray a word of anything that you tell me,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not for any kinship nor alliance,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But truly for love and trust."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus they are sworn, and thereupon they kissed,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And each of them told the other what they pleased.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cousin," she said, "if I had a space of time,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have none, and especially in this place,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then would I tell a legend of my life,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I have suffered since I was a wife<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of my husband, although he is your cousin."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nay," said this monk, "by God and Saint Martin,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is no more cousin unto me<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than is this leaf that hangs on the tree!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I call him so, by Saint Denis of France,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To have the more opportunity of acquaintance<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With you, whom I have loved especially<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Above all women, certainly.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This I swear to you on my religious vows.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tell your grief, lest that he come down;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And hasten you, and go your way quickly."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; These old noble Bretons in their days<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of diverse adventures made lays,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Rhymed in their first Breton tongue,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Which lays with their instruments they sang<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or else read them for their pleasure;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And one of them have I in remembrance,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Which I shall say with as good will as I can.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But, sirs, because I am an unlearned man,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; At my beginning first I you beseech,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Have me excused for my rude speech.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I learned never rhetoric, certainly;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thing that I speak, it must be bare and plain.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I slept never on the Mount of Parnassus,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Nor learned Marcus Tullius Cicero.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Colors know I none, without doubt,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But such colors as grow in the field,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or else such as men dye or paint.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Colors of rhetoric (figures of speech) are strange to me;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; My spirit feels nothing of such matter.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But if you wish, you shall hear my tale.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In Armorica, that is called Brittany,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There was a knight that loved and worked hard<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To serve a lady in his best manner;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And many a labor, many a great chivalric exploit,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He wrought for his lady before she was won.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For she was the fairest of all under the sun,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And also moreover come of such noble ancestry<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That this knight hardly dared, for fear,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Tell her his woe, his pain, and his distress.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But at the last she, for his worthiness,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And namely for his meek submission,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Has taken such a pity on his suffering<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That privately she agreed with him<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To take him for her husband and hir lord,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of such lordship as men have over their wives.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And to lead the more blissfully their lives,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of his free will he swore her as a knight<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That never in all his life he, day or night,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Should take upon himself any mastery<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Against her will, nor show her jealousy,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But obey her, and follow her will in everything,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As any lover to his lady should,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Except for the appearance of sovereignty,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Which he would have to avoid bringing shame on his status (of knighthood). <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She thanked him, and with full great humbleness<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She said, "Sir, since of your nobility<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You offer me to have such freedom from restraint,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And would God that never between us two,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Through my fault, should be either war or strife.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Sir, I will be your humble true wife --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Have here my pledge -- until my heart bursts (until I die)." <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thus are they both in quiet and in peace.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For one thing, sirs, I dare say confidently,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That friends must obey each other,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If they will long hold company.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Love will not be constrained by mastery.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When mastery comes, the God of Love immediately<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Beats his wings, and farewell, he is gone!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Love is a thing free as any spirit.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Women, by nature, desire liberty,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And not to be constrained like a slave;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And so do men, if I shall say the truth.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Look who is most patient in love,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He is in the best position, superior to all.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Patience is a noble virtue, certainly,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For it vanquishes, as these clerks say,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Things that rigor should never attain.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; One may not chide or complain for every word.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Learn to suffer, or else, as I may walk (I swear),<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You shall learn it, whether you want to or not;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For in this world, certainly, there is no person <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who does not sometime do or speak amiss.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Ire, sickness, or the position of the stars,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Wine, woe, or changing of the balance of bodily humors<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Causes (one) very often to do or speak amiss.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; On every wrong a man can not be avenged.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There must be moderation suitable to the occasion <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; By every person who knows about governance. <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And therefore has this wise, worthy knight,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To live in ease, promised her forbearance,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And she to him full truly did swear<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That never should there be fault in her.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Here may men see a humble, wise accord;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thus has she taken her servant and her lord --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Servant in love, and lord in marriage.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Then was he both in lordship and servitude.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Servitude? Nay, but in lordship above,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Since he has both his lady and his love;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His lady, certainly, and his wife also,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The which accords to the law of love.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And when he was in this happy state,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Home with his wife he goes to his country,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Not far from Pedmark, where his dwelling was,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Where he lives in bliss and in pleasure.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who could tell, unless he had been wedded,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The joy, the ease, and the happiness<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That is between a husband and his wife?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A year and more lasted this blissful life,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Until the knight of whom I thus speak,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That was called Arveragus of Kayrrud,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Prepared himself to go and dwell a year or two<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In England, which was also called Britain,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To seek in arms good reputation and honor --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For he set all his desire in such labor --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And dwelled there two years; the book says thus.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Now will I stop (speaking) of this Arveragus,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And I will speak of Dorigen his wife,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who loves her husband as her heart's life.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For his absence she weeps and sighs,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As do these noble wives when it pleases them.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She mourns, stays awake, wails, fasts, complains;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Desire of his presence so presses upon her<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That all this wide world she reckoned as worth nothing.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Her friends, who knew her gloomy thought,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Comfort her in all that ever they can.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They preach to her, they tell her night and day<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That she slays herself without cause, alas!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And every comfort possible in this case<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They do to her with all their concern,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; All to make her leave her sadness.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In the course of time, as every one of you knows,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; One may so long engrave on a stone<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Until some figure is imprinted upon it.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So long have they comforted her until she<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Received has, by hope and by reason,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The imprint of their consolation,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Through which her great sorrow began to be relieved;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She can not always continue in such passionate grief.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And also Arveragus, in (the midst of) all this care, <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Has sent her letters home (telling) of his welfare,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And that he will come hastily again;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or else this sorrow would have slain her heart.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Her friends saw her sorrow began to slacken<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And prayed her on their knees, for God's sake,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To come and walk about in company,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Away to drive her dark imagining.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And finally she granted that request,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For well she saw that it was for the best.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Now her castle stood close by the sea,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And often with her friends she walks<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To amuse herself upon the bank on high,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Where she saw many a ship and sailing vessel<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Sailing their course, where it pleases them to go.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But then was that a portion of her woe,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For to herself full often, she says "Alas!",<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Is there no ship, of so many as I see,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Will bring home my lord? Then would my heart be<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; All cured of its bitter, sharp pains."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Another time there would she sit and think,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And cast her eyes downward from the brink.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But when she saw the grisly black rocks,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For sheer fear her heart would so quake<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That on her feet she could not sustain herself.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Then would she sit down upon the green,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And piteously stare into the sea,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And say right thus, with sorrowful, cold sighs:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Eternal God, who through thy foreknowledge<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Leads the world by sure governance, <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Men say you make nothing in vain.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But, Lord, these grisly fiendish black rocks,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That seem rather a foul confusion<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of work than any fair creation<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of such a perfectly wise and stable God,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Why have you created this unreasonable work?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For by this work, south, north, nor west, nor east,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There is no benefit to man, nor bird, nor beast;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It does no good, to my understanding, but does harm.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; See you not, Lord, how it destroys mankind?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A  hundred thousand bodies of mankind<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Have rocks slain, although their names are forgotten,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And this mankind is so fair a part of thy work<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That thou made it like to thine own image.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Then it seemed you had a great love<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Toward mankind; but how then may it be<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That you make such means to destroy it,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Which means do no good, but always cause trouble?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I know well clerks will say as they please,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; By logical reasoning, that all is for the best,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Though I can not know the causes.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But that same God that made wind to blow<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Keep my lord! This is my conclusion.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To clerks I leave all disputation.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But would God that all these black rocks <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Were sunk into hell for his sake!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; These rocks slay my heart for fear."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thus would she say, with many a piteous tear.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Her friends saw that it was no pleasure<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To roam by the sea, but discomfort,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And decide to amuse themselves somewhere else.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They lead her by rivers and by springs,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And also in other delightful places;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They dance and they play at chess and backgammon.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So on a day, early in the morning-tide,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Unto a garden that was there nearby,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In which they had made their arrangement<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For victuals and for other provisions,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They go and amuse themselves all the long day.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And this was on the sixth morning of May,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Which May had painted with its soft showers<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This garden full of leaves and of flowers;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And craft of man's hand so skillfully<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Had adorned this garden, truly,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That never was there garden of such worth<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Unless it were the true paradise.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The odor of flowers and the fresh sight<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Would have made any heart light<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That ever was born, unless too great sickness<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or too great sorrow held it in distress,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It was so full of beauty with pleasure.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; After dinner they go to dance,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And sing also, save Dorigen alone,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who made always her complaint and her moan,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For she did not see him on the dance go<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who was her husband and her love also.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But nonetheless she must a time abide<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And with good hope let her sorrow slip away.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In this dance, among other men,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Danced a squire before Dorigen,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who was more lively and more gaily dressed,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As to my judgement, than is the month of May.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He sings, dances, passing any man<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That is, or was, since the world began.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Therewith he was, if one should him describe,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; One of the most handsome men alive;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Young, strong, very valiant, and rich, and wise,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And well beloved, and held in great esteem.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And shortly, if I shall tell the truth,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Unknown by this Dorigen at all,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This lusty squire, servant to Venus,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who was called Aurelius,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Had loved her best of any creature<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Two years and more, as was his fate,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But he never dared tell her his grievance.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Copiously he drank all his penance (suffered intensely).<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He was in despair; he dared say nothing,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Except in his songs somewhat he would reveal<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His woe, as in a general lament;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He said he loved and was in no way loved in return<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of such subject matter made he many lays,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Songs, complaints, roundels, virelays,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (Saying) how he dared not his sorrow tell,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But suffers as a fury does in hell;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And he must die, he said, as did Echo<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For Narcissus, she who dared not tell her woe.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In other ways than you hear me say,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He dared not reveal to her his woe,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Except that, by chance, sometimes at dances,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Where young folk observe their customs (of courtship),<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It may well be he looked on her face<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In such a manner as a man that asks for grace;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But she knew nothing of his intent.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Nonetheless it happened, before they went away,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Because he was her neighbor,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And was a man of good reputation and honor,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And (she) had known him for a long time,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They fell in speech; and forth, more and more,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Unto his purpose drew Aurelius,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And when he saw his time, he said thus:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Madame," he said, "by God that this world made,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Providing that I knew it might gladden your heart,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I wish that day that your Arveragus<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Went over the sea, that I, Aurelius,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Had went from where I should never have come back.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For well I know my service is in vain;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; My reward is but the breaking of my heart.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Madame, have pity upon my bitter pains;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For with one word you may me slay or save.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Here at your feet would God that I were buried!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I have now no opportunity to say more;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Have mercy, sweet, or you will make me die!"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She did look upon Aurelius;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Is this your desire," said she, "and say you thus?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Never before," she said, "Did I know what you meant.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But now, Aurelius, I know your intention,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; By that same God that gave me soul and life,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I shall never be an untrue wife<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In word nor deed, so long as I have my wits;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I will be his to whom that I am knit.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Take this for my final answer."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But after that in play thus she said:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Aurelius," she said, "by high God above,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Yet would I grant you to be your love,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Since I see you so piteously lament.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; On whatever day that from end to end of Brittany<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You remove all the rocks, stone by stone,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So that they do not prevent ship nor boat to go --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I say, when you have made the coast so clean<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of rocks that there is no stone seen,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Then will I love you best of any man;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Have here my pledged word, in all that is in my power."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Is there no other grace in you?" he said.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "No, by that Lord," she said, "that made me!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For well I know that it shall never happen.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Let such follies pass out of your heart.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What pleasure should a man have in his life<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To go love another man's wife,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who has her body whenever he pleases?"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Aurelius very often bitterly sighs;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Woe was Aurelius when he heard this,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And with a sorrowful heart he thus answered:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Madame," he said, "this would be an impossiblity!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Then I must die of sudden horrible death."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And with that word he turned away immediately.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Then came her other friends many a one,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And in the garden paths roamed up and down,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And knew nothing of this business,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But suddenly began to revel anew<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Until the bright sun lost its hue;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For the horizon has bereft the sun of its light --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This is as much to say that it was night --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And home they go in joy and in pleasure,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Save only wretched Aurelius, alas!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He to his house is gone with sorrowful heart.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He sees he can not escape from his death;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He thought that he felt his heart grow cold.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Up to the heaven his hands he did hold,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And on his bare knees he set himself down,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And in his delirium said his prayer. <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For utter woe out of his wits he suddenly went.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He knew not what he spoke, but thus he said;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With piteous heart he has begun his complaint <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Unto the gods, and first unto the sun:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He said, "Apollo, god and governor<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of every plant, herb, tree, and flower,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That gives, according to thy height (in the sky),<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To each of them its time and its season,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As thy astronomical position changes low or high,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Lord Phoebus, cast thy merciful eye<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; On wretched Aurelius, who is as good as lost.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Lo, lord! My lady has sworn my death <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Without guilt, unless thy kindness<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Upon my dying heart have some pity.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For well I know, lord Phoebus, if you wish,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You can help me best (of anyone), except for my lady.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Now grant that I may tell you<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; How I may be helped and in what manner.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Your blissful sister, Lucina the bright,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who of the sea is chief goddess and queen<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (Though Neptune have godly dominion in the sea,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Yet empress above him is she),<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You know well, lord, that just as her desire<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Is to be kindled and ignited by your fire, <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For which she follows you very attentively,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Just so the sea desires naturally<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To follow her, as she that is goddess<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Both in the sea and rivers great and small.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Wherefore, lord Phoebus, this is my request --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Do this miracle, or make my heart break --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That now at this next opposition (of the sun and moon)<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Which shall be in the sign of the Lion,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Pray her so great a high tide to bring<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That five fathoms at the least it rise above<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The highest rock in Armorican Brittany;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And let this flood-tide endure for two years.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Then certainly to my lady may I say,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; `Keep your promise, the rocks are away.'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Lord Phoebus, do this miracle for me.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Pray her that she go at no faster speed as you;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I say, pray your sister that she go<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; At no faster speed as you for these two years.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Then shall she be fully even with you always,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And spring flood will last both night and day.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And unless she agree in such manner<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To grant me my sovereign lady dear,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Pray her to sink every rock down<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Into her own dark region<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Under the ground, in which Pluto dwells,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or never more shall I win my lady.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thy temple in Delphi I will barefoot seek.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Lord Phoebus, see the tears on my cheek,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And on my pain have some compassion."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And with that word he fell down in a faint,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And for a long time he lay in a trance.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His brother, who knew of his suffering,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Caught him up and to bed he has him brought.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Despaired in this torment and this thought<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I leave this woeful creature lying;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Let him choose, for all I care, whether he will live or die. <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Arveragus, with well-being and great honor,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As he that was of chivalry the flower,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Is come home, and other worthy men.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; O blissful art thou now, thou Dorigen,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That hast thy lusty husband in thine arms,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The vigorous knight, the worthy man of arms,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That loves thee as his own heart's life.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He not at all desired to be suspicious,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If any person had spoken, while he was away,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To her of love; he had of it no fear.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He pays no attention to any such matter,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But dances, jousts, makes her good cheer;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And thus in joy and bliss I let them dwell,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And of the sick Aurelius I will tell.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In suffering and in hellish torment<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Two years and more lay wretched Aurelius,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Before he could set a foot on the ground;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Nor had he any comfort in this time,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Except from his brother, who was a clerk.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He knew of all this woe and all this suffering,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For to no other creature, certainly,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He dared say any word of this matter.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Under his breast he bore it more secretly<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Than ever did Pamphilus for Galathee.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His breast was unhurt, in outward appearance,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But in his heart ever was the sharp arrow.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And well you know that for a wound healed only on the surface<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In surgery the treatment is perilous,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Unless one could touch the arrow or grasp it.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His brother wept and wailed secretly,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Until at the last he remembered,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That while he was at Orleans in France --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As young clerks that are eager<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To read arts that are arcane<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Seek in every nook and every cranny<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To learn specialized branches of learning --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He remembered that, one day,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; At Orleans in a study hall he saw a book<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of natural science, which his fellow,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who was at that time a bachelor of law,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Although he was there to learn another craft,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Had covertly left upon his desk;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Which book spoke much of the operations<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Concerning the eight and twenty stations<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That belong to the moon, and such folly<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As in our days is not worth a fly --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For holy church's faith in our belief<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Does not allow any illusion to grieve us.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And when this book was in his remembrance,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Straightway for joy his heart began to dance,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And to himself he said secretly,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "My brother shall be cured speedily;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For I am sure that there are sciences<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; By which men make diverse illusions,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Such as these subtle illusionists play.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For often at feasts have I well heard say<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That illusionists within a large hall <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Have made come in a water and a barge,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And in the hall row up and down.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Sometimes a grim lion has seemed to come;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And sometimes flowers spring as in a field;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Sometimes a vine, and grapes white and red;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Sometimes a castle, all of mortar and stone;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And when they pleased, they made it suddenly disappear.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thus it seemed to every man's sight.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Now then conclude I thus: that if I might<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; At Orleans find some old fellow<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who had these moon's stations in mind,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or other natural science beyond that<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He should well make my brother have his love.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For with an apparition a clerk may make it seem,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To man's sight, that all the rocks black<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of Brittany were removed every one,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And ships by the shore come and go,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And in such form endure a week or two.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Then my brother would be cured of his woe;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Then must she by necessity keep her promise,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or else he shall shame her at the least."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Why should I make a longer tale of this?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Unto his brother's bed he is come,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And such encouragement he gave him to go<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To Orleans that he leaped up immediately,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And on his way forth then is he gone<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In hope to be relieved of his care.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When they had come almost to that city,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Not more than two or three furlongs,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A young clerk roaming by himself they met,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who in Latin politely greeted them,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And after that he said a wonderful thing:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "I know," he said, "the cause of your coming."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And before they went any foot farther,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He told them all that was in their intention.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This Breton clerk asked him about fellows<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Whom he had known in old days,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And he answered him that they were dead,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For which he wept very often many a tear.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Down off his horse Aurelius alighted straightway,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And with this magician forth he is gone<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Home to his house, and put them well at ease.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They lacked no foods that might please them.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So well appointed a house as this one was <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Aurelius in his life saw never a one.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He showed him, before he went to supper,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Forests, parks full of wild deer;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There he saw harts with their high horns,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The greatest that ever were seen with eye.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He saw a hundred of them slain by hounds,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And some bled because of bitter wounds from arrows.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He saw, when these wild deer were removed,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; These hunters with falcons upon a fair riverbank,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That with their hawks have slain the heron.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Then he saw knights jousting in a plain;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And after this he provided him such pleasure<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That he showed him his lady in a dance,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In which he himself danced, as he thought.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And when this master that wrought this magic <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Saw it was time, he clapped his two hands,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And farewell! All our revel was gone.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And yet moved they never out of the house,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; While they saw all this marvelous sight,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But in his study, where his books are,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They sat still, and no person (was there) but these three.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This master called his squire to him,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And said to him thus: "Is our supper ready?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Almost an hour it is, I declare,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Since I ordered you to make our supper,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When these worthy men went with me<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Into my study, where my books are."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Sir," said this squire, "when it pleases you,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It is all ready, even if you want it right now."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Go we then to sup," said he, "as is the best (to do).<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; These amorous folk sometime must have their rest."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; At after-supper they began to discuss<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What sum this master's payment should be<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To remove all the rocks of Brittany,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And also from Gironde to the mouth of Seine.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He raised difficulties, and swore, as God may him save,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Less than a thousand pounds he would not have,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Nor would he go gladly even for that sum. <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Aurelius, with blissful heart, at once<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Answered thus: "Fie on a thousand pounds!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This wide world, which men say is round,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I would give it, if I were lord of it.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This bargain is fully concluded, for we are agreed.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You shall be paid truly, by my pledged word!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But look now, for no negligence or laziness<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You delay us here any longer than to-morrow."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Nay," said this clerk, "have here my faith as a pledge."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To bed is gone Aurelius when it pleased him,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And well nigh all that night he had his rest.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What for his labor and his hope of bliss,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His woeful heart of suffering had relief.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Upon the morrow, when it was day,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To Brittany took they the direct route,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Aurelius and this magician beside him,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And are arrived where they would stay.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And this was, as these books remind me,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The cold, frosty season of December.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Phoebus grew old, and colored grayish silver,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That in his hot declination (in summer)<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Shone like burnished gold with bright rays;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But now in Capricorn he alights down,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Where he shone full pale, I dare well say.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The bitter frosts, with the sleet and rain,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Have destroyed the green in every garden.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Janus sits by the fire, with double beard,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And drinks the wine from his buffalo horn;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Before him stands meat of the tusked boar,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And "Noel" cries every lusty man.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Aurelius in all that ever he can<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Provides for this master entertainment and reverence,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And prays him to work diligently<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To bring him out of his bitter pains,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or with a sword he would slit his heart.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This subtle clerk had such pity for this man<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That night and day he worked as fast as he can<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To seek a time for his astronomical operation; <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This is to say, to make illusion,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; By such an appearance or conjurer's trick --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I know no technical terms of astrology --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That she and every person should believe and say<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That the rocks of Brittany were away,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or else they were sunk under ground.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So at the last he has his time found<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To make his tricks and his wretched deeds<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of such a superstitious cursedness.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His astronomical tables of Toledo he brought forth,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Accurately corrected, nor was there anything lacking,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Neither his tables of single years nor of twenty-year periods,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Nor his dates for calculations, nor his other apparatus,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Such as are his table of distances and his angles for calculation<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And his table for computing motions (of the planets)<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For his divisions of the sphere in every detail. <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And by his eighth sphere in his working<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He knew full well how far the star Alnath was shoved<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; From the head of that fixed Aries above,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That in the ninth sphere is observed;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Full subtly he calculated all this.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When he had found his first position of the moon,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He knew the remnant by astronomical tables,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And knew the arising of his moon well,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And in which planet's face and term (zodiacal divisions), and everything;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And knew full well the moon's position<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In accordance with his operation,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And knew also his other observations<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For such illusions and such evil practices<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As heathen folk used in those days.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For which no longer he made delay,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But through his magic, for a week or two,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It seemed that all the rocks were away.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Aurelius, who is yet in despair <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Whether he shall have his love or fare badly,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Waits night and day for this miracle;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And when he knew that there was no obstacle,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That every one of these rocks were removed,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Down to his mistress' feet he fell at once,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And said, "I woeful wretched, Aurelius,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thank you, lord, and my lady Venus,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who have helped me out of my deadly cares."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And to the temple he has held forth his way,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Where he knew he should see his lady.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And when he saw his time, immediately he,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With fearful heart and with full humble manner,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Has saluted his sovereign lady dear:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "My true lady," said this woeful man,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Whom I most dread and love as I best know how,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And am of all this world most reluctant to displease,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Were it not that I for you have such distress<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That I must die here at your feet right now,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I would tell nothing of how I am beset by woe. <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But certainly either I must die or complain;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You slay me guiltless for sheer pain.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But though you have no pity on my death,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Think carefully before you break your pledged word.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Repent, for that God above,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Before you slay me because I love you.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For, madam, you know well what you have promised --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Not that I claim any thing as a right<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; From you, my sovereign lady, except for your good favor --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But in a garden yonder, at a particular place,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You know right well what you promised me;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And in my hand you pledged your word<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To love me best -- God knows, you said so,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Although I am unworthy of it.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Madam, I speak it for your honor<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; More than to save my heart's life right now --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I have done as you commanded me;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And if you agree, you may go see.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Do as you please; have your promise in mind,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For, living or dead, right there you shall find me.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In you lies the power to make me live or die --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But well I know the rocks are away."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He takes his leave, and she astounded stood;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In all her face was not a drop of blood.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She never expected to have come in such a trap.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Alas," she said, "that ever this should happen!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For I never supposed by possibility<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That such a wonder or marvel could be!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It is against the laws of nature."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And home she goes a sorrowful creature;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For sheer fear she can hardly walk.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She weeps, wails, all one day or two,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And swoons, that it was pitiful to see.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But why it was she told to no person,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For Arveragus had gone out of town.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But to herself she spoke, and said thus,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With face pale and with full sorrowful manner,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In her complaint, as you shall after hear:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Alas," said she, "on thee, Fortune, I complain,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That without warning hast wrapped me in thy chain,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; From which to escape I know no help, <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Save only death or else dishonor;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; One of these two I am compelled to choose.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But neverthelees, yet I would rather lose<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; My life than of my body to have a shame,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or know myself false, or lose my good name;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And with my death I may be free from blame, indeed.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Has there not many a noble wife before this,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And many a maid, slain herself, alas,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Rather than do sin with her body?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Yes indeed, certainly, lo, these stories bear witness:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When thirty tyrants, full of cursedness,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Had slain Phidon in Athens at the feast,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They commanded (the guards) to seize his daughters <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And bring them before them as an insult,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; All naked, to fulfill their foul delight,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And in their father's blood they made them dance<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Upon the pavement, God give them misfortune!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For which these woeful maidens, full of dread,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Rather than they would lose their maidenhood,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They secretly have leaped into a well<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And drowned themselves, as the books tell.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "They of Messene had (people) search out and seek<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Fifty maidens of Sparta also,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; On whom they would do their lechery.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But there was none of all that company<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That she was not slain, and with a good intent<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Chose rather to die than assent<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To be deprived of her maidenhood.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Why should I then be afraid to die?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Lo, also, the tyrant Aristoclides,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That loved a maiden, called Stymphalides,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When her father was slain on a night,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Unto Diana's temple she goes directly,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And seized the statue in her two hands,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; From which statue she would never go.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; No person could pull her hands away from it <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Until she was slain, right in the same place.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Now since maidens had such disdain<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To be defiled by man's foul delight,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Well ought a wife rather herself slay<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Than be defiled, as it seems to me.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What shall I say of Hasdrubale's wife,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That at Carthage deprived herself of her life?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For when she saw that Romans won the town,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She took her children all, and leaped down<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Into the fire, and chose rather to die<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Than any Roman did her a dishonor.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Has not Lucretia slain herself, alas,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; At Rome, when she was raped<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; By Tarquin, for she thought it was a shame<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To live when she had lost her good name?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The seven maidens of Miletus also<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Have slain themselves, for sheer dread and woe,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Rather than folk of Galatia should rape them.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; More than a thousand stories, as I guess,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Could I now tell concerning this matter.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When Habradate was slain, his wife so dear<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Herself slew, and let her blood pour<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In Habradate's wounds deep and wide,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And said, `My body, at the least,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There shall no person defile, if I can (help it)."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Why should I tell more examples concerning this,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Since so many have themselves slain<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Well rather than they would be defiled?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I will conclude that it is better for me<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To slay myself than be defiled thus.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I will be true unto Arveragus,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or rather slay myself in some manner,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As did Demotion's daughter dear<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Because she would not defiled be.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; O Scedasus, it is a very great pity<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To read how thy daughters died, alas,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who slew themselves for a similar sort of cause.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As great a pity was it, or well more,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Theban maiden that for Nichanore<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Slew herself, exactly for such sort of woe.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Another Theban maiden did exactly the same;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Because one of Macedonia had raped her,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She with her death avenged her maidenhood.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What shall I say of Nicerates' wife,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That for a similar case deprived herself of her life?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; How true also to Alcebiades was<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His lover, who chose rather to die <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Than to allow his body to be unburied.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Lo, what a wife was Alcestis," she said.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "What says Homer of good Penelope?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; All Greece knows of her chastity.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; By God, of Laodomia is written thus,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That when at Troy Protheselaus was slain,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; No longer would she live after his day (i.e., death).<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The same of noble Portia I can tell;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Without Brutus she could not live,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To whom she had entirely given her heart.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The perfect wifehood of Arthemesie<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Honored is through all heathendom.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; O Teuta, queen, thy wifely chastity<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To all wives may be a mirror.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The same thing I say of Bilia,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of Rhodogune, and also Valeria."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thus Dorigen complained a day or two,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Intending ever that she would die.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But neverthelees, upon the third night,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Home came Arveragus, this worthy knight,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And asked her why she wept so bitterly;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And she began to weep, ever the longer (she wept) the more (she wept) . <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Alas," said she, "that ever I was born!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thus have I said," said she, "thus have I sworn" --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And told him all as you have heard before;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There is no need to repeat it to you any more.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This husband, with cheerful demeanor, in a friendly manner<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Answered and said as I shall tell you:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Is there anything else, Dorigen, but this?"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Nay, nay," she said, "So help me God!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This is too much, even if it were God's will."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Yes, wife," he said, "let sleep that which is still.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It may be well, perhaps, yet to day.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You shall keep your pledged word, by my faith!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For as surely as God may have mercy upon me,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I had well rather be stabbed <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For sheer love which I to have for you,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Than you should (do anything but) keep and save your pledged word.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; One's pldged word is the highest thing that one may keep" --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But with that word he immediately burst into tears,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And said, "I you forbid, upon pain of death,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That never, while thy life or breath lasts,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thou tell any person about this adventure --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As I best can, I will my woe endure --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Nor make any outward appearance of sadness,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That folk may believe or guess anything harmful concerning you."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And forth he called a squire and a maid:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Go forth right now with Dorigen," he said,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "And bring her to such a place quickly."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They take their leave, and on their way they go,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But they knew not why she thither went.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He would no person tell his intention.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Perhaps a heap of you, indeed,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Will consider him a foolish man in this<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That he will put his wife in jeopardy.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Listen to the tale before you cry out about her.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She may have better fortune than it seems to you;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And when you have heard the tale, judge.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This squire, who was called Aurelius,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; On Dorigen who was so amorous,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; By chance happened to meet her <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Amidst the town, right in the busiest street,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As she was about to go the way directly<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Toward the garden where she had promised (to go).<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And he was going toward the garden also;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For well he spied when she would go<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Out of her house to any sort of place.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But thus they met, by chance or luck,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And he salutes her cheerfully,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And asked her where she went;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And she answered, as if she were half mad,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Unto the garden, as my husband commanded,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; My pledged word to keep -- alas, alas!"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Aurelius began to wonder about this case,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And in his heart had great compassion<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of her and of her lamentation,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And of Arveragus, the worthy knight,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who commanded her to keep all that she had promised,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So hateful to him it was that his wife should break her word;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And in his heart he took great pity on this,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Considering what would be best in every respect,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That he would rather yet refrain from his desire<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Than do so great a churlish despicable act<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Against generosity and all nobility of character;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For which in few words he said thus:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Madam, say to your lord Arveragus<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That since I see his great graciousness<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To you, and also I see well your distress,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That he would rather have shame (and that would be a pity)<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Than you should thus break your pledged word to me,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I would well rather suffer woe always<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Than I should break apart the love between you two.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I release you, madam, into your hand I return<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Freely every pledge and every bond<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That you have made to me before now,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Since that time when you were born.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I pledge my word, I shall never reprove you <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For any promise, and here I take my leave,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of the truest and the best wife<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That ever yet I knew in all my life.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But let every wife beware of her promise!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Remember Dorigen, at the least.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thus can a squire do a gentle deed<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As well as can a knight, without doubt."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She thanks him upon her bare knees,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And home unto her husband she is gone,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And told him all, as you have heard me say;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And be you sure, he was so well pleased<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That it would be impossible for me to write.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Why should I write longer about this matter?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Arveragus and Dorigen his wife<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In perfect bliss lead forth their life.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Never again was there any anger between them.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He cherishes her as though she were a queen,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And she was to him true for evermore.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of these two folk you get of me no more.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Aurelius, that all his expenditure has forfeited,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Curses the time that ever he was born:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Alas!" said he. "Alas, that I promised<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of refined gold a thousand pounds of weight<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Unto this scientist! What shall I do?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I see no more but that I am ruined.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; My heritage I must of necessity sell,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And be a beggar; here I may not remain<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And shame all my kin in this place,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Unless I can get a better grace (favor) from him.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But nonetheless, I will try him, (offering)<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; At specific days, year by year, to pay,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And thank him for his great courtesy.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; My word I will keep, I will not lie."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With a sore heart he goes unto his money box,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And brought gold unto this scientist,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The value of five hundred pounds, I guess,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And him beseeches, of his nobleness,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To grant him days (on which to pay) the remnant;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And said, "Master, I dare well make boast,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I failed never of my pledged word as yet.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For surely my debt shall be repaid<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To you, even though I have<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To go a-begging in my bare tunic.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But if you would agree, upon my promise,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To grant me a respite for two years or three,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Then I would be well; for otherwise I must sell<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; My heritage; there is no more to tell."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This scientist soberly answered,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And said thus, when he heard these words:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Have I not kept my agreement with thee?"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Yes, certainly, well and truly," said he.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Hast thou not had thy lady as it pleases thee?"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "No, no," said he, and sorrowfully he sighs.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "What was the cause? Tel me if thou know how."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Aurelius his tale immediately began,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And told him all, as you have heard before;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There is no need to repeat it to you again.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He said, "Arveragus, of his nobility,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Had rather die in sorrow and in distress<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Than that his wife would be false of her pledged word."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The sorrow of Dorigen he told him also;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; How loathfull to her it was to be a wicked wife,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And that she would rather have lost her life that day,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And that her word she swore through ignorance,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She never before had heard tell of illusion.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "That made me have for her such great pity;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And right as freely as he sent her to me,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As freely I sent her to him again.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This is the entire matter; there is no more to say."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This scientist answered, "Dear brother,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Every one of you did nobly to the other.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thou art a squire, and he is a knight;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But God forbid, for his blissful might,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That a clerk could not do a gentle deed <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As well as any of you, it is no doubt!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Sir, I release thee from thy (debt of a) thousand pounds,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As if thou right now were crept out of the ground,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Nor never before now had known me.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For, sir, I will not take a penny from thee<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For all my craft, nor anything for my labor.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thou hast paid well for my living expenses.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It is enough, and farewell, have good day!"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And took his horse, and forth he goes his way.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Gentlemen, this question, then, will I ask now,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Which was the most free, as it seems to you?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Now tell me, before you farther go.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I know no more; my tale is at an end.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Great was the feast in Athens that day,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And also the pleasing season of that May<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Made every person to be in such delight<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That all that Monday they joust and dance,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And spend that day in Venus's noble service.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But because they must rise<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Early, to see the great fight,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Unto their rest they went at nightfall.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And in the morning, when day did spring,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Noise and clattering of horses and armor <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There was in hostelries all about,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And to the palace there rode many a company<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Of lords upon steeds and palfreys.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There canst thou see preparation of armor<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So exotic and so rich, and wrought so well<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Of goldsmiths' works, of embroidery, and of steel;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The bright shields, horses' head-armor, and horse-armor,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Gold-colored helms, coats of mail, tunics with heraldic devices; <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Lords in richly decorated robes on their coursers,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Knights of  (their) retinues, and also squires<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nailing heads to the spear-shafts, and buckling helms;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Fitting the shields with straps, fastening with laces --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Where it is needed they were not at all idle;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The steeds frothing on the golden bridles<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Gnawing, and fast the armorers also<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With file and hammer are spurring to and fro;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Yeomen on foot, and foot soldiers many a one<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With short staves, thick as they can go;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Pipes, trumpets, kettle drums, bugles,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That blow bloody sounds in the battle;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The palace full of people everywhere,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Here three, there ten, debating, <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Conjecturing about these two Theban knights.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Some said thus, some said "it shall be so";<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Some held with him with the black beard,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Some with the bald, some with the thickly haired;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Some said he looked grim, and he would fight:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"He has a battle-ax of twenty pounds of weight."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Thus was the hall full of conjecturing,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Long after the sun began to rise.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The great Theseus, who was awakened of his sleep<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;By the music and noise that was made,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Remained yet in the chamber of his rich palace <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Until the Theban knights, both equally<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Honored, were fetched into the palace.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Duke Theseus was set at a window,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Arrayed exactly as if he were a god on a throne.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The people press thither full soon<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In order to see him, and to do great reverence,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And also to hear his command and his decision.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A herald on a scaffold made a "Ho!"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Until all the noise of people was done,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And when he saw the people all still of noise,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Then showed he the mighty duke's will:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"The lord has of his great sound judgment<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Considered that it would be destruction<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To gentle blood to fight in the manner<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Of mortal battle now in this undertaking.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Wherefore, to arrange matters so that they shall not die,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He will modify his previous plan.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;No man therefore, upon punishment of loss of life,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;No sort of arrow, nor battle-axe, nor short knife<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Send into the lists or bring there;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nor short sword, to stab with piercing point,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;May no man neither draw, nor bear it by his side.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And no man shall ride at his opponent<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;More than one course with a sharply honed spear; <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Let him thrust, if he wishes, on foot, to defend himself.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And he who is at a disadvantage shall be taken<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And not slain, but be brought unto the stake<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That shall be placed on either side;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But thither he must (go) by force, and remain there.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And if so happen that the chieftain be taken<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;On either side, or else should slay his opponent,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The tournament shall last no longer.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;God give you success! Go forth and lay on fast!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With long sword and with mace fight your fill.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Go now on your way; this is the lord's will."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The voice of people touched the heaven,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So loudly they cried with merry voices,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"God save such a lord, that is so good<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He desires no destruction of blood!"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Up go the trumpets and the melody,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And to the lists rides the company,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In battle array, throughout all the city, <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Hung with cloth of gold, and not with serge.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Fully like a lord this noble duke did ride,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;These two Thebans upon either side,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And after rode the queen and Emelye,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And after that another company<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;One after another, according to their rank.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And thus they pass throughout the city,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And they come to the lists in good time.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It was not yet fully prime (nine a.m.) of the day <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When Theseus was set very splendidly and nobly,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ypolita the queen, and Emelye,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And other ladies about in tiers.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Unto the seats press all the crowd.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And westward, through the gates under Mars,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Arcite, and also the hundred of his party,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With red banner is entered right away;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And in that same moment Palamon<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Is under Venus, eastward in the place,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With white banner and hardy countenance and face.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In all the world, to seek up and down,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So evenly, without variation,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There were not two such companies,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For there was no one so wise that could say<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That any one had advantage over the other <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In worthiness, nor in status, nor age,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So evenly were they chosen, as I estimate.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And in two fair ranks they arrange themselves.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When every one of their names were read,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So that in their total number there would be no deception,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Then the gates were shut, and cried was aloud:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Do now your duty, proud young knights!"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The heralds left their spurring up and down;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Now trumpets and bugles ring loud. <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There is no more to say, but from west and east<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In go the spears very firmly in the lance-rests;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In goes the sharp spur into the flank.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There people see who can joust and who can ride;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There splinter spears upon thick shields;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He feels the stabbing through the breast-bone.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Up spring spears twenty foot on height;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Out go the swords bright as silver;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The helms they hew to pieces and cut into shreds<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Out burst the blood in strong red streams;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With mighty maces they break the bones to pieces.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He did thrust through the thickest of the throng;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There strong steeds stumble, and down goes all,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He rolls under foot as does a ball;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;On his feet he stabs with the broken shaft of his spear,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And he hurtles him down with his horse;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He is hurt through the body and then taken,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Despite all he can do, and brought unto the stake;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As was the agreement, right there he must abide.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Another on that other side is led away.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And for a while Theseus makes them rest,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To refresh themselves and drink, if they wish.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Many times these two Thebans have  <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Met together, and (each) wrought woe to his opponent;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Each has unhorsed the other of them two.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There was not any tiger in the vale of Gargaphia, <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When her whelp is stolen when it is little,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So cruel on the hunt as is Arcite<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For jealous heart upon this Palamon.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nor in Benmarin there is not so fierce a lion,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That is hunted, or maddened by his hunger,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nor of his prey desires so the blood,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As Palamon to slay his foe Arcite.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The fervent strokes bite on their helms;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Out runs red blood on both their sides.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Some time there is an end of every deed.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For before the sun went unto its rest,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The strong king Emetreus did seize<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This Palamon, as he fought with Arcite,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And made his sword deep in his flesh to bite,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And by the force of twenty he (Palamon) is taken  <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Without having surrendered, and dragged to the stake.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And in the rescue of this Palamon<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The strong king Lygurge is born down,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And king Emetreus, despite all his strength,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Is carried out of his saddle a sword's length,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So hit him Palamon before he was taken.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But all for naught; he was brought to the stake.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;His hardy heart could not help him:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He must abide, when he was caught,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;By force and also by the agreed terms of battle.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Who sorrows now but woeful Palamon,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That must no more go again to fight?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And when Theseus had seen this sight,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Unto each one of the folk that fought thus <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He cried, "Stop! no more, for it is done!  <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I will be true judge, and no partisan.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Arcite of Thebes shall have Emelye,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Who by his fortune has won her fairly."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Immediately there is a noise of people begun<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For joy of this, so loud and clamorous indeed<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It seemed that the lists should fall.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;What now can fair Venus do above?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;What says she now? What does this queen of love,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But weeps so, for lack of (having) her will,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Until her tears fell in the lists? <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She said, "I am disgraced, doubtless."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Saturn said, "Daughter, hold thy peace!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mars has his will, his knight has all his request,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And, by my head, thou shalt be relieved soon."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The trumpeters, with the loud music,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The heralds, who full loudly yell and cry,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Are in their happiest state for joy of dan Arcite.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But listen to me, and stop the noise for a little,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(Hear) what a miracle at once befell there.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This fierce Arcite has taken off his helm,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And on a war horse, to show his face,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He spurs from one end to the other of the large open space<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Looking upward upon this Emelye;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And she to him cast a friendly eye<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(For women, so to speak in general,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;They all follow the favor of Fortune)<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And was all his source of pleasure, in his heart.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Out of the ground leaped an infernal fury,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Sent from Pluto at the request of Saturn,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For which his horse for fear began to turn,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And leaped aside, and stumbled as he leaped;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And before Arcite can take heed,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He hit himself on the top of his head,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That in the place he lay as if he were dead,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;His breast shattered by his saddlebow.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He lay as black as any coal or crow,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The blood was so run in his face.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Immediately he was carried out of the place,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With painful heart, to Theseus's palace.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Then was he cut out of his armor<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And brought in a bed very gently and quickly,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For he was yet conscious and alive,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And always crying for Emelye.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Duke Theseus, with all his company,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Is come home to Athens, his city,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With all bliss and great solemnity.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Although this accident had happened,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He would not distress them all.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;People said also that Arcite shall not dye;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He shall be healed of his injuries.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And of another thing they were as happy,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That of them all there was no one slain,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Although they (were) sorely hurt, and especially one,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Whose breastbone was pierced by a spear.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To other wounds and to broken arms<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Some had salves, and some had charms;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Medicines made of herbs, and also of sage<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;They drank, for they wanted to have their limbs cured.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For which this noble duke, as he well knows how,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Comforts and honors every man,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And made revel all the long night<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For the foreign lords, as was right.  <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nor was it considered any defeat (in battle)<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But (only) as a joust or a tournament;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For truly there was no defeat.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For falling is nothing but an accident,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nor to be led by force unto the stake<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Without having surrendered, and taken by twenty knights,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;One person alone, without others,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And dragged forth by arm, foot, and toe,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And also his steed driven forth with staves<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;By men on foot, both yeomen and also foot soldiers --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He incurred no shameful blame for it; <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; No man there may call it cowardice.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For which anon duke Theseus had proclaimed,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To put a stop to all rancor and ill-will,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The victory (is given) as well to one side as to the other,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And either side equal as the other's brother; <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And gave them gifts in accordance with their ranks,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And held a feast for fully three days,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And honorably escorted the kings <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Out of his town a full day's journey.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And home went every man the direct way.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There was no more but "Fare well, have good day!"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Of this battle I will write no more,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But speak of Palamon and of Arcite.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The breast of Arcite swells, and the pain<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;At his heart increases more and more.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The clotted blood, despite any medical treatment,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Corrupts, and is left in the trunk of his body,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That neither blood letting at a vein, nor applying suction cups,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nor drink of herbs can be any help to him.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The power expulsive (to expel fluids), or animal,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;From that power called natural<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Can not remove nor expel the poison.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The pipes of his lungs began to swell,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And every muscle down in his breast<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Is destroyed by poison and corrupted matter.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Avails him neither, to preserve his life,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Vomit upward, nor downward laxative.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;All is shattered in that region;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nature now has no power to control. <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And certainly, where Nature will not work,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Fare well medicine! Go bear the man to church!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This is the whole of it, that Arcite must die;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For which he sends after Emelye,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And Palamon, who was his dear cousin.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Then said he thus, as you shall after hear:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"The woeful spirit in my heart can not<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Declare one small part of all my painful sorrows<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To you, my lady, whom I love most,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But I bequeath the service of my ghost<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To you above every creature,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Since my life can no longer endure.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Alas, the woe! Alas, the strong pains,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That I have suffered for you, and so long!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Alas, the death! Alas, my Emelye!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Alas, separation of our company!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Alas, my heart's queen! Alas, my wife,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;My heart's lady, ender of my life!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;What is this world? What do people ask to have?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Now with his love, now in his cold grave<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Alone, without any company.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Fare well, my sweet foe, my Emelye!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And softly take me in your two arms,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For love of God, and listen to what I say.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I have here with my cousin Palamon<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Had strife and rancor many a day ago<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For love of you, and for my jealousy.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And as Jupiter may guide my soul,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To speak specifically of a servant (of love),<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With all the attendant attributes truly --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That is to say, truth, honor, knighthood,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Wisdom, humbleness, rank, and noble ancestry,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nobility of character, and all that belongs to that art --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As Jupiter may have concern for my soul,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In this world right now I know no one<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So worthy to be loved as Palamon,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Who serves you, and will do so all his life.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And if ever you shall be a wife,   <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Forget not Palamon, the gentle man."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And with that word his speech began to fail,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For from his feet up to his breast had come<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The cold of death, which had overcome him,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And yet moreover, for in his two arms <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The vital strength is lost and all gone.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Only the intellect, nothing else,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That dwelled in his heart sick and sore,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Began to fail when the heart felt death.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;His two eyes grew dark, and his breath failed,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But on his lady yet he cast his eye;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;His last word was, "Mercy, Emelye!"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;His spirit changed house and went where,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Since I came never (there), I can not tell where.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Therefore I stop; I am no theologian;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I find nothing about souls in this register,  <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nor do I wish to tell such beliefs  <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Of them, though they write of where they (the souls) dwell.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Arcite is cold, may Mars guide his soul!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Now will I speak forth of Emelye.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Emelye shrieked, and Palamon howls,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And Theseus immediately took his sister <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Swooning, and carried her away from the corpse.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;What helps it to waste the whole day<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To tell how she wept both evening and morning?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For in such cases women have such sorrow,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When their husbands are gone from them,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That for the most part they so sorrow,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Or else fall in such illness<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That at the last certainly they die.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Infinite are the sorrows and the tears<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Of old folk and folk of tender years<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In all the town for the death of this Theban.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For him there weep both child and man;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There was no such great weeping, certainly,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When Hector was brought, just recently slain,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To Troy. Alas, the lamentation that was there,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Scratching of cheeks, also tearing of hair.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Why wouldst thou be dead," these women cry,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Since thou haddest gold enough, and Emelye?"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;No man might comfort Theseus,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Except for his old father Egeus,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Who knew the changes of this world,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As he had seen it change both up and down,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Joy after woe, and woe after gladness,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And showed them examples and comparisons.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Right as there died never a man," said he,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Who did not live in earth to some extent<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Just so there lived never a man," he said,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"In all this world, who some time did not die.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This world is nothing but a thoroughfare full of woe,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And we are pilgrims, passing to and fro.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Death is an end of every worldly pain."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And beyond all this yet he said much more<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To this effect, full wisely to exhort<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The people that they should comfort themselves. <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Duke Theseus, with all his careful attention,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Considered now where the tomb<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Of good Arcite may best be made,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And also most honorable in (regard to) his rank.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And at the last he concluded<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That there where first Arcite and Palamon<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Had the battle between them for love,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That in that same grove, sweet-smelling and green, <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Where he had his amorous desires,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;His lament, and for love his hot fires,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He would make a fire in which the rite<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Of a funeral he might fully perform.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And he ordered immediately to hack and hew<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The old oaks, and lay them in a row<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In piles arranged to burn well.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;His officers with swift feet they run<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And ride quickly at his commandment.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And after this, Theseus has sent<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For a bier, and it all overspread<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With cloth of gold, the richest that he had.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And of the same material he clad Arcite;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Upon his hands he had white gloves,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Also on his head a crown of green laurel,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And in his hand a sword full bright and keen.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He laid him, with the face bare, on the bier;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Therewith he wept that it was a pity to hear.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And in order that all the people should see him,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When it was day, he brought him to the hall,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That resounds with the crying and the sound.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Then came this woeful Theban Palamon,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With waving beard and rough hair sprinkled with ashes,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In black clothes, all sprinkled with tears;  <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And, excelling others in weeping, Emelye,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The most pitiful of all the company.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In order that the ritual should be<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The more noble and rich in its degree,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Duke Theseus had three steeds brought forth,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That were equipped with trappings of steel all glittering,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And covered with the coat of arms of Don Arcite.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Upon these steeds, that were large and white,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There sat folk, of which one carried his (Arcite's) shield,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Another held his spear upright in his hands,  <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The third carried with him his Turkish bow<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(Of pure gold was the quiver and also the fittings);<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And they rode forth slowly with sorrowful demeanor<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Toward the grove, as you shall later hear.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The noblest of the Greeks that were there <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Carried the bier upon their shoulders,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With slow pace and eyes red and wet,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Throughout the city by the main street,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Which was all spread with black, and wonderfully high<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The street is covered with exactly the same.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Upon the right hand went old Egeus,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And on that other side duke Theseus,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With vessels of pure gold in their hands,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;All full of honey, milk, and blood, and wine;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Also Palamon, with a very large company;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And after that came woeful Emelye,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With fire in hand, as was at that time the custom,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To do the office of funeral service.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Much labor and full great preparation <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Was at the service and the fire-making,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Which with its green top reached the heaven;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And twenty fathom of breadth the sides stretched --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This is to say, the boughs were so broad.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There was first laid very many a load of straw.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But how the fire was made on high,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nor also the names that the trees are called,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Such as oak, fir, birch, aspen, alder, holm oak, poplar,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Willow, elm, plane, ash, box, chestnut, linden, laurel,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Maple, thorn, beech, hazel, yew, dogwood --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;How they were cut down shall not be told by me;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nor how the gods ran up and down,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Disinherited of their habitation,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In which they dwelt in rest and peace,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nymphs, fawns and hamadryades (wood nymphs);<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nor how the beasts and the birds all<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Fled for fear, when the wood was cut down;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nor how frightened by the light was the ground,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Which was not accustomed to see the bright sun;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nor how the fire was laid first with straw,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And then with dry branches cut in thirds,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And then with green wood and mixtures of spices,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And then with cloth of gold and with precious stones<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And garlands, hanging with full many a flower;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The myrrh, the incense, with such great fragrance;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nor how Arcite lay among all this,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nor what richness about his body is;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nor how Emelye, as was the custom,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Lighted the fire of funeral service;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nor how she swooned when men made the fire,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nor what she spoke, nor what was her desire;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nor what jewels men threw in the fire,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When the fire was great and burned fast;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nor how some threw their shields, and some their spears,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And of their vestments, which they wore,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And cups full of wine, and milk, and blood,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Into the fire, that burned as if it were mad;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nor how the Greeks, with a huge company,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Thrice ride all the fire about<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Upon the left hand, with a loud shouting,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And thrice with their spears clattering;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And thrice how the ladies did cry;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And how Emelye was led homeward;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nor how Arcite is burned to cold ashes;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nor how that wake was held  <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;All that same night; nor how the Greeks play<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The funeral games I care not to say<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Who wrestles best, naked with oil anointed,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nor who bore him best, in any difficulty.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I will not tell also how they go<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Home to Athens, when the games are done;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But shortly to the point then I will go<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And make an end of my long tale.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;By the course of events and by length of a certain number of years,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;All stopped is the mourning and the tears<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Of the Greeks, by one general assent.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Then it seemed to me there was a parliament<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;At Athens, upon certain topics and cases;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Among which topics was discussed (a proposal)<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To have alliance with certain countries,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And have fully the submission of the Thebans.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For which this noble Theseus immediately<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ordered (someone) to send for gentle Palamon,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Unknown by him (Palamon) what was the cause and why,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But in his black clothes sorrowfully<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He came at his (Theseus's) commandment in haste.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Then Theseus sent for Emelye.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When they were set, and all the place was hushed,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And Theseus had waited for a while<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Before any word came from his wise breast,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He set his eyes where his object of desire was.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And with a sad face he sighed softly,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And after that exactly thus he pronounced his decision:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"The First Mover of the First Cause above,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When he first made the faire chain of love,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Great was the effect, and noble was his plan.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Well knew he why, and what thereof he meant,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For with that faire chain of love he bound<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The fire, the air, the water, and the land<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In definite bounds, from which they may not flee.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That same Prince and that Mover," said he,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Has established in this wretched world below<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Specific (numbers of) days and  (term of) duration<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To all that is engendered in this place,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Beyond the which day they can not pass,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Although they may yet well shorten those days.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There is no need to cite any written authority,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For it is proven by experience,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Unless I wish to make my meaning more clear.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Then one can by this order well discern<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That that same Mover is stable and eternal.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Well may one know, unless it be a fool,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That every part derives from its whole,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For nature has not taken its beginning<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Of no part or portion of a thing,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But of a thing that is complete and stable,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Descending (from that) until it becomes corruptible.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And therefore, by his wise foresight,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He has so well established his plan<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That types of being and natural processes<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Shall endure (for a set time) one after another,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And not eternally, without any lie.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This thou canst understand and plainly see.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Lo the oak, that is so slow to mature,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;From the time that it first begins to spring,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And has so long a life, as we may see,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Yet at the last the tree is wasted away.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Consider also how the hard stone<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Under our feet, on which we tread and go,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Eventually it is worn away as it lies by the way.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The broad river sometimes grows dry;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We see the great cities grow weak and pass away.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Then you can see that all things have an end.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Of man and woman also we see well <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That by necessity, in one of these two periods of time --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This is to say, in youth or else in age --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He must be dead, the king as must a servant boy;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;One in his bed, one in the deep sea,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;One in the large field, as people can see;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nothing helps there; all goes that same way.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Then may I say that all things must die.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"What causes this but Jupiter, the king,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Who is prince and cause of all things,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Causing all to return to its own origin<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;From which it is derived, to tell the truth?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And against this no living creature,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Of any rank, is helped by striving.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Then is it wisdom, as it seems to me,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To make virtue of necessity,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And take it well what we may not escape,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And namely that which is due to us all.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And whoever complains in any way, he does folly,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And is rebel to Him that can rule all.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And certainly a man has most honor<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To die in his (time of) excellence and flower,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When he is sure of his good name;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Then he has not done his friend, nor himself, any shame.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And his friend ought to be more pleased with his death,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When his breath is yielded up with honor,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Than when his name is faded because of age,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For all forgotten is his knightly prowess.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Then is it best, for a worthy fame,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To die when he has the most fame.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"The contrary of all this is willfulness.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Why do we complain, why do we have sadness,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That good Arcite, flower of chivalry,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Is departed with all due honor<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Out of this foul prison of this life?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Why do his cousin and his wife complain here<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Of the welfare of him, who loved them so well?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Can he show them his gratitude? Nay, God knows, not a bit;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;They offend both his soul and themselves as well,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And as yet they may not change their desires.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"What  can I conclude of this long argument,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But after woe I advise us to be merry<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And thank Jupiter for all his grace?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And before we depart from this place<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I advise that we make of two sorrows <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;One perfect joy, lasting evermore.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And look now, where most sorrow is herein,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There will we first amend and begin.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Sister," said he, "this is my full intention,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With all the advice of my parliament here,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That gentle Palamon, your own knight,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Who serves you with will, heart, and might,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And ever has done so since you first knew him,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That you shall of your grace have pity upon him,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And take him for husband and for lord.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Lend me your hand, for this is our decision.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Let your womanly pity now be seen.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He is a king's brother's son, indeed;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And even if he were a poor young knight,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Since he has served you so many a year,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And has had for you such great adversity,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It must be taken in account, believe me,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For gentle mercy ought to prevail over justice."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Then said he thus to Palamon the knight:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I suppose little preaching is needed here<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To make you assent to this thing.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Come near, and take your lady by the hand."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Between them was made right away the bond<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That is called matrimony or marriage,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;By all the council and the baronage.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And thus with all bliss and festivity<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Palamon has wedded Emelye.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And God, who has made all this wide world,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Send him his love who has dearly paid for it;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For now is Palamon in complete happiness,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Living in bliss, in riches, and in health,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And Emelye loves him so tenderly,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And he serves her so gently,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That never was there any word between them <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Of jealousy or any other vexation.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Thus ends Palamon and Emelye;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And God save all this fair company! Amen.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When April with its sweet-smelling showers<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has pierced the drought of March to the root,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And bathed every vein (of the plants) in such liquid<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;By which power the flower is created;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When the West Wind also with its sweet breath,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In every wood and field has breathed life into <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The tender new leaves, and the young sun<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Has run half its course in Aries,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And small fowls make melody,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Those that sleep all the night with open eyes<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(So Nature incites them in their hearts),<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Then folk long to go on pilgrimages,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And professional pilgrims to seek foreign shores,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To distant shrines, known in various lands;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And specially from every shire's end<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Of England to Canterbury they travel,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To seek the holy blessed martyr,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Who helped them when they were sick.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It happened that in that season on one day,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In Southwark at the Tabard Inn as I lay<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ready to go on my pilgrimage<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To Canterbury with a very devout spirit,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;At night had come into that hostelry<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Well nine and twenty in a company<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Of various sorts of people, by chance fallen<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In fellowship, and they were all pilgrims,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Who intended to ride toward Canterbury.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The bedrooms and the stables were spacious,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And we were well accommodated in the best way.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And in brief, when the sun was (gone) to rest,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I had so spoken with everyone of them <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That I was of their fellowship straightway,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And made agreement to rise early,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To take our way where I (will) tell you.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But nonetheless, while I have time and opportunity,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Before I proceed further in this tale,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It seems to me in accord with reason<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To tell you all the circumstances<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Of each of them, as it seemed to me,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And who they were, and of what social rank,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And also what clothing that they were in;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And at a knight then will I first begin.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A KNIGHT there was, and that (one was) a worthy man,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Who from the time that he first began<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To ride out, he loved chivalry,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Fidelity and good reputation, generosity and courtesy.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He was very worthy in his lord's war,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And for that he had ridden, no man farther,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As well in Christendom as in heathen lands,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And (was) ever honored for his worthiness;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He was at Alexandria when it was won.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He had sat very many times in the place of honor,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Above (knights of) all nations in Prussia;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He had campaigned in Lithuania and in Russia,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;No Christian man of his rank so often.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Also he had been in Grenada at the siege <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Of Algeciras, and had ridden in Morocco.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He was at Ayash and at Atalia,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When they were won, and in the Mediterranean<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He had been at many a noble expedition.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He had been at fifteen mortal battles,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And fought for our faith at Tlemcen<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Three times in formal duels, and each time slain his foe.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This same worthy knight had also been <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;At one time with the lord of Balat<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Against another heathen in Turkey;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And evermore he had an outstanding reputation<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And although he was brave, he was prudent,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And of his deportment as meek as is a maid.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He never yet said any rude word<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In all his life unto any sort of person.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He was a truly perfect, noble knight.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But to tell you of his clothing,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;His horses were good, but he was not gaily dressed.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He wore a tunic of coarse cloth <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;All stained (with rust) by his coat of mail,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For he was recently come (back) from his expedition,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And went to do his pilgrimage.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With him there was his son, a young SQUIRE,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A lover and a lively bachelor,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With locks curled as if they had been laid in a curler.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He was twenty years of age, I guess.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Of his stature he was of moderate height,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And wonderfully agile, and of great strength.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And he had been for a time on a cavalry expedition<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In Flanders, in Artois, and Picardy,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And conducted himself well, for so little a space of time,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In hope to stand in his lady's good graces.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He was embroidered, as if it were a mead<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;All full of fresh flowers, white and red.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Singing he was, or fluting, all the day;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He was as fresh as is the month of May.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;His gown was short, with long and wide sleeves.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He well knew how to sit on horse and handsomely ride.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He knew how to make songs and well compose (the words),<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Joust and also dance, and well draw and write.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He loved so passionately that at nighttime<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He slept no more than does a nightingale.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Courteous he was, humble, and willing to serve,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And carved before his father at the table.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He (the Knight) had A YEOMAN and no more servants <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;At that time, for it pleased him so to travel,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And he (the yeoman) was clad in coat and hood of green.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A sheaf of peacock arrows, bright and keen,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He carried under his belt very properly<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(He well knew how to care for his equipment as a yeoman should;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;His arrows did not fall short because of drooping feathers),<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And in his hand he carried a mighty bow.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He had a close-cropped head, with a brown face.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He well knew all the practice of woodcraft.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He wore an elegant archer's wrist-guard upon his arm,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And by his side a sword and a small shield,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And on that other side an elegant dagger<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Well ornamented and sharp as the point of a spear;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A Christopher-medal of bright silver on his breast.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He carried a horn, the shoulder strap was green;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He was a forester, truly, as I guess.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There was also a Nun, a PRIORESS,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Who was very simple and modest in her smiling;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Her greatest oath was but by Saint Loy;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And she was called Madam Eglantine.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She sang the divine service very well,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Intoned in her nose in a very polite manner;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And she spoke French very well and elegantly,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In the manner of Stratford at the Bow,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For French of Paris was to her unknown.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;At meals she was well taught indeed;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She let no morsel fall from her lips,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nor wet her fingers deep in her sauce;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She well knew how to carry a morsel (to her mouth) and take good care<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That no drop fell upon her breast.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Her greatest pleasure was in good manners.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She wiped her upper lip so clean<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That in her cup there was seen no tiny bit <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Of grease, when she had drunk her drink.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She reached for her food in a very seemly manner.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And surely she was of excellent deportment,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And very pleasant, and amiable in demeanor,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And she took pains to imitate the manners<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Of court, and to be dignified in behavior,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And to be considered worthy of reverence.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But to speak of her moral sense,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She was so charitable and so compassionate<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She would weep, if she saw a mouse<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Caught in a trap, if it were dead or bled.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She had some small hounds that she fed<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With roasted meat, or milk and fine white bread.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But sorely she wept if one of them were dead,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Or if someone smote it smartly with a stick;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And all was feeling and tender heart.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Her wimple was pleated in a very seemly manner,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Her nose well formed, her eyes gray as glass,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Her mouth very small, and moreover soft and red.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But surely she had a fair forehead;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It was almost nine inches broad, I believe;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For, certainly, she was not undergrown.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Her cloak was very well made , as I was aware.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;About her arm she bore of small coral <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A set of beads, adorned with large green beads,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And thereon hung a brooch of very bright gold,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;On which there was first written an A with a crown,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And after "Love conquers all."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She had another NUN with her,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Who was her secretary, and three priests.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There was a MONK, an extremely fine one,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;An outrider (a monk with business outside the monastery), who loved hunting,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A virile man, qualified to be an abbot.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He had very many fine horses in his stable,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And when he rode, one could hear his bridle<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jingle in a whistling wind as clear<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And also as loud as does the chapel belle<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Where this lord was prior of the subordinate monastery.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The rule of Saint Maurus or of Saint Benedict --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Because it was old and somewhat strict<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This same Monk let old things pass away,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And followed the broader customs of modern times.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He gave not a plucked hen for that text<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That says that hunters are not holy men,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nor that a monk, when he is heedless of rules,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Is like a fish that is out of water --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This is to say, a monk out of his cloister.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But he considered that same text not worth an oyster;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And I said his opinion was good.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Why should he study and make himself crazy,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Always to pore upon a book in the cloister,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Or work with his hands, and labor,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As Augustine commands? How shall the world be served?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Let Augustine have his work reserved to him!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Therefore he was indeed a vigorous horseman:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He had greyhounds as swift as fowl in flight;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Of tracking and of hunting for the hare<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Was all his pleasure, by no means would he refrain from it.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I saw his sleeves lined at the hand<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With squirrel fur, and that the finest in the land;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And to fasten his hood under his chin,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He had a very skillfully made pin of gold;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There was an elaborate knot in the larger end.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;His head was bald, which shone like any glass,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And his face did too, as if he had been rubbed with oil.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He was a very plump lord and in good condition;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;His eyes were prominent, and rolling in his head,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Which gleamed like a furnace under a cauldron;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;His boots supple, his horse in excellent condition.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Now certainly he was a handsome ecclesiastical dignitary;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He was not pale as a tormented spirit.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A fat swan loved he best of any roast.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;His saddle horse was as brown as is a berry.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There was a FRIAR, a pleasure-loving and merry one,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A limiter (with an assigned territory), a very solemn man.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In all the four orders of friars is no one that knows<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So much of sociability and elegant speech.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He had made very many a marriage<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Of young women at his own cost.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He was a noble supporter of his order.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Very well beloved and familiar was he<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With landowners every where in his country,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And also with worthy women of the town;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For he had power of confession,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As he said himself, more than a parish priest,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For he was licensed by his order.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He heard confession very sweetly,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And his absolution was pleasant:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He was a lenient man in giving penance,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Where he knew he would have a good gift.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For to give to a poor order (of friars)<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Is a sign that a man is well confessed;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For if he gave, he (the friar) dared to assert,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He knew that a man was repentant;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For many a man is so hard in his heart,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He can not weep, although he painfully suffers.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Therefore instead of weeping and prayers<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;One may give silver to the poor friars.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;His hood was always stuffed full of knives<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And pins, to give to fair wives.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And certainly he had a merry voice:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He well knew how to sing and play on a rote (string instrument);<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He absolutely took the prize for reciting ballads.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;His neck was white as a lily flower;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Furthermore he was strong as a champion fighter.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He knew the taverns well in every town<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And every innkeeper and barmaid<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Better than a leper or a beggar-woman,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For unto such a worthy man as he<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It was not suitable, in view of his official position,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To have acquaintance with sick lepers.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It is not respectable; it can not be profitable,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To deal with any such poor people,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But all with rich people and sellers of victuals.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And every where, where profit should arise,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He was courteous and graciously humble;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There was no man anywhere so capable (of such work).<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He was the best beggar in his house;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; [And he gave a certain fee for his grant (of begging rights);<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; None of his brethren came there in his territory;]<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For though a widow had not a shoe,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So pleasant was his "In the beginning,"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Yet he would have a farthing, before he went away.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His total profit was much more than his proper income.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And he knew how to frolic, as if he were indeed a pup.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He knew how to be much help on days for resolving disputes,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For there he was not like a cloistered monk<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With a threadbare cope, like a poor scholar,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But he was like a master of arts or a pope.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Of wide (expensive) cloth was his short cloak,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Which was round as a bell fresh from the clothespress.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Somewhat he lisped, for his affectation,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To make his English sweet upon his tongue;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And in his harping, when he had sung,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;His eyes twinkled in his head exactly<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As do the stars in the frosty night.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This worthy friar was called Huberd.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There was a MERCHANT with a forked beard,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Wearing parti-colored cloth, and proudly he sat on his horse;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Upon his head (he wore a) Flemish beaver hat,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;His boots were buckled handsomely and elegantly.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;His opinions he spoke very solemnly,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Concerning always the increase of his profits.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He wanted the sea to be guarded at all costs<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Between Middelburgh (Holland) and Orwell (England).<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He well knew how to deal in foreign currencies.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This worthy man employed his wit very well:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There was no one who knew that he was in debt,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He was so dignified in managing his affairs<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With his buying and selling and with his financial deals.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Truly, he was a worthy man indeed,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But, to say the truth, I do not know what men call him.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There was also a CLERK (scholar) from Oxford,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Who long before had begun the study of logic.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;His horse was as lean as is a rake,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And he was not very fat, I affirm,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But looked emaciated, and moreover abstemious.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;His short overcoat was very threadbare,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For he had not yet obtained an ecclesiastical living,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nor was he worldly enough to take secular employment.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For he would rather have at the head of his bed<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Twenty books, bound in black or red,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Of Aristotle and his philosophy<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Than rich robes, or a fiddle, or an elegant psaltery. <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But even though he was a philosopher,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nevertheless he had but little gold in his strongbox;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But all that he could get from his friends,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He spent on books and on learning,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And diligently did pray for the souls <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Of those who gave him the wherewithal to attend the schools.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He took most care and paid most heed to study.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He spoke not one word more than was needed,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And that was said with due formality and respect,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And short and lively and full of elevated content;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;His speech was consonant with moral virtue,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And gladly would he learn and gladly teach.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A SERGEANT OF THE LAW (high-ranking attorney), prudent and wise,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Who often had been at the Porch of St. Paul's (where lawyers gather)<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Was also there, very rich in superior qualities.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He was judicious and of great dignity --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He seemed such, his words were so wise.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He was very often a judge in the court of assizes,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;By royal appointment and with full jurisdiction.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For his knowledge and for his excellent reputation,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He had many grants of yearly income.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There was nowhere so great a land-buyer:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In fact, all was unrestricted possession to him;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;His purchasing could not be invalidated.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There was nowhere so busy a man as he, <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And yet he seemed busier than he was.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He had in Year Books all the cases and decisions<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That from the time of king William have occurred.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Furthermore, he knew how to compose and draw up a legal document,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So that no one could find a flaw in his writing;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And he knew every statute completely by heart.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He rode but simply in a parti-colored coat,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Girded with a belt of silk, with small stripes;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I tell no longer tale of his clothing.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A FRANKLIN was in his company.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;His beard was white as a daisy;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As to his temperament, he was dominated by the humor blood.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He well loved a bit of bread dipped in wine in the morning;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;His custom was always to live in delight,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For he was Epicurus' own son,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Who held the opinion that pure pleasure <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Was truly perfect happiness.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He was a householder, and a great one at that;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He was Saint Julian (patron of hospitality) in his country.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;His bread, his ale, was always of the same (good) quality;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nowhere was there any man better stocked with wine.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;His house was never without baked pies<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Of fish and meat, and that so plentiful<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That in his house it snowed with food and drink;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Of all the dainties that men could imagine,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In accord with the various seasons of the year,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So he varied his midday meal and his supper.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He had very many fat partridges in pens,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And many a bream and many a pike in his fish pond.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Woe was his cook unless his sauce was<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Hotly spiced and sharp, and ready all his cooking equipment.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In his hall his dining table always<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Stood covered (with table cloth) and ready all the long day.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He presided as lord and sire at court sessions;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He was a member of parliament many times.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A dagger and a purse all of silk<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Hung at his belt, white as morning milk.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He had been a sheriff, and an auditor of taxes.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There was nowhere such a worthy landowner.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A HABERDASHER and a CARPENTER,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A WEAVER, a DYER, and a TAPESTRY-MAKER --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And they were all clothed in one livery<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Of a solemn and a great parish guild.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Their equipment was adorned all freshly and new;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Their knives were not mounted with brass<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But entirely with silver, wrought very neatly and well,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Their belts and their purses every bit.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Each of them well seemed a solid citizen<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To sit on a dais in a city hall.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Every one of them, for the wisdom that he knows,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Was suitable to be an alderman.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For they had enough possessions and income,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And also their wives would well assent to it;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And otherwise certainly they would be to blame.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It is very fine to be called "my lady,"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And go to feasts on holiday eves heading the procession,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And have a gown with a train royally carried.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A COOK they had with them for the occasion<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To boil the chickens with the marrow bones,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And tart poudre-marchant and galingale (spices).<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He well knew how to judge a draft of London ale.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He knew how to roast, and boil, and broil, and fry,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Make stews, and well bake a pie.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But it was a great harm, as it seemed to me,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That he had an open sore on his shin.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As for white pudding, he made that of the best quality.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A SHIPMAN was there, dwelling far in the west;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For all I know, he was from Dartmouth.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He rode upon a cart horse, insofar as he knew how,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In a gown of woolen cloth (that reached) to the knee.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He had a dagger hanging on a cord <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;About his neck, down under his arm.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The hot summer had made his hue all brown;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And certainly he was a boon companion.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He had drawn very many a draft of wine<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;While coming from Bordeaux, while the merchant slept.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He had no concern for a scrupulous conscience.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;If he fought and had the upper hand,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He sent them home by water to every land (they walked the plank). <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But of his skill to reckon well his tides,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;His currents, and his perils near at hand,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;His harbors, and positions of his moon, his navigation,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There was none other such from Hull to Cartagena (Spain).<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He was bold and prudent in his undertakings;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;His beard had been shaken by many a tempest.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He knew all the harbors, how they were,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;From Gotland to the Cape of Finisterre,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And every inlet in Brittany and in Spain.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;His ship was called the Maudelayne.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With us there was a DOCTOR OF MEDICINE<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In all this world there was no one like him,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To speak of medicine and of surgery,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For he was instructed in astronomy.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He took care of his patient very many times<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In (astronomically suitable) hours by (use of) his natural science.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He well knew how to calculate the planetary position<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Of his astronomical talismans for his patient.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He knew the cause of every malady,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Were it of hot, or cold, or moist, or dry elements,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And where they were engendered, and by what bodily fluid.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He was a truly, perfect practitioner:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The cause known, and the source of his (patient's) harm,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Straightway he gave the sick man his remedy.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He had his apothecaries all ready <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To send him drugs and his electuaries,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For each of them made the other to profit --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Their friendship was not recently begun.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He well knew the old Aesculapius,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And Dioscorides, and also Rufus,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Old Hippocrates, Haly, and Galen,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Serapion, Rhazes, and Avicenna,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Averroes, John the Damascan, and Constantine,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Bernard, and Gaddesden, and Gilbertus.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He was moderate in his diet,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For it was of no excess,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But greatly nourishing and digestible.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;His study was but little on the Bible.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He was clad all in red and in blue,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Lined with taffeta and with silk.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And yet he was moderate in spending;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He kept what he earned in (times of) plague.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Since in medicine gold is a restorative for the heart,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Therefore he loved gold in particular.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There was a good WIFE OF beside BATH,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But she was somewhat deaf, and that was a pity.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She had such a skill in cloth-making <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She surpassed them of Ypres and of Ghent.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In all the parish there was no wife <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Who should go to the Offering before her;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And if there did, certainly she was so angry<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That she was out of all charity (love for her neighbor).<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Her kerchiefs were very fine in texture;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I dare swear they weighed ten pound<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That on a Sunday were upon her head.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Her stockings were of fine scarlet red,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Very closely laced, and shoes very supple and new.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Bold was her face, and fair, and red of hue.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She was a worthy woman all her life:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She had (married) five husbands at the church door,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Not counting other company in youth --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But there is no need to speak of that right now.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And she had been three times at Jerusalem;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She had passed many a foreign sea;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She had been at Rome, and at Boulogne,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In Galicia at Saint-James (of Compostella), and at Cologne.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She knew much about wandering by the way.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She had teeth widely set apart, truly to say.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She sat easily upon a pacing horse,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Wearing a large wimple, and on her head a hat<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As broad as a buckler or a shield;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;An overskirt about her large hips,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And on her feet a pair of sharp spurs.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In fellowship she well knew how to laugh and chatter.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She knew, as it happened, about remedies for love <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For she knew the old dance (tricks of the trade) of that art.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A good man was there of religion,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And (he) was a poor PARSON OF A TOWN,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But he was rich in holy thought and work.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He was also a learned man, a scholar,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Who would preach Christ's gospel truly;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He would devoutly teach his parishioners.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He was gracious, and wonderfully diligent,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And very patient in adversity,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And such he was proven many times.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He was very reluctant to excommunicate for (nonpayment of) his tithes,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But rather would he give, there is no doubt,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Unto his poor parishioners about<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Some of his offering (received at mass) and also some of his income.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He knew how to have sufficiency in few possessions.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;His parish was wide, and houses far apart,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But he did not omit, for rain nor thunder,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In sickness or in trouble to visit<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Those living farthest away in his parish, high-ranking and low,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Going by foot, and in his hand a staff.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He gave this noble example to his sheep,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That first he wrought, and afterward he taught.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He took those words out of the gospel,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And this metaphor he added also to that,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That if gold rust, what must iron do?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For if a priest, on whom we trust, should be foul<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It is no wonder for a layman to go bad;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And it is a shame, if a priest is concerned:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A shit-stained shepherd and a clean sheep.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Well ought a priest to give an example,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;By his purity, how his sheep should live.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He did not rent out his benefice (ecclesiastical living)<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And leave his sheep encumbered in the mire<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And run to London unto Saint Paul's<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To seek an appointment as a chantry priest (praying for a patron)<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Or to be hired (as a chaplain) by a guild;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But dwelt at home, and kept well his sheep fold (parish),<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So that the wolf did not make it go wrong;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He was a shepherd and not a hireling.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And though he was holy and virtuous,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He was not scornful to sinful men,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nor domineering nor haughty in his speech,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But in his teaching courteous and kind.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To draw folk to heaven by gentleness,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;By good example, this was his business.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Unless it were an obstinate person,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Whoever he was, of high or low rank,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He would rebuke him sharply at that time. <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I believe that nowhere is there a better priest.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He expected no pomp and ceremony,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nor made himself an overly fastidious conscience,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But Christ's teaching and His twelve apostles <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He taught; but first he followed it himself.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With him there was a PLOWMAN, who was his brother,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Who had hauled very many a cartload of dung;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He was a true and good worker,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Living in peace and perfect love.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He loved God best with all his whole heart<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;At all times, whether it pleased or pained him,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And then (he loved) his neighbor exactly as himself.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He would thresh, and moreover make ditches and dig,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For Christ's sake, for every poor person,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Without payment, if it lay in his power.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He paid his tithes completely and well,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Both of  his own labor and of his possessions.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He rode in a tabard (sleeveless jacket) upon a mare.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There was also a REEVE, and a MILLER,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A SUMMONER, and a PARDONER also,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A MANCIPLE, and myself -- there were no more.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The MILLER was a stout fellow indeed;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He was very strong of muscle, and also of bones.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That was well proven, for wherever he came,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;At wrestling he would always take the the prize.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He was stoutly built, broad, a large-framed fellow;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There was no door that he would not heave off its hinges,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Or break it by running at it with his head.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;His beard was red as any sow or fox,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And moreover broad, as though it were a spade.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Upon the exact top of his nose he had<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A wart, and thereon stood a tuft of hairs,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Red as the bristles of a sow's ears;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;His nostrils were black and wide.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He wore a sword and a buckler by his side.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;His mouth was as large as a large furnace.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He was a loudmouth and a buffoon,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And that was mostly of sin and deeds of harlotry.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He well knew how to steal corn and take payment three times;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And yet he had a thumb of gold, indeed.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He wore a white coat and a blue hood.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He well knew how to blow and play a bag-pipe,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And with that he brought us out of town.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There was a fine MANCIPLE of a temple (law school),<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Of whom buyers of provisions might take example<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For how to be wise in buying of victuals;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For whether he paid (cash) or took (goods) on credit,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Always he watched so (carefully for his opportunity) in his purchases<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That he was always ahead and in good state.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Now is not that a very fair grace of God <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That such an unlearned man's wit shall surpass<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The wisdom of a heap of learned men?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He had more than three times ten masters,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Who were expert and skillful in law,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Of whom there were a dozen in that house<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Worthy to be stewards of rent and land<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Of any lord that is in England,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To make him live by his own wealth<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In honor and debtless (unless he were crazy),<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Or live as economically as it pleased him to desire;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And (they would be) able to help all a shire<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In any emergency that might occur or happen.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And yet this Manciple fooled them all.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The REEVE was a slender choleric man.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;His beard was shaved as close as ever he can;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;His hair was closely cropped by his ears;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The top of his head in front was cut short like a priest's.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;His legs were very long and very lean,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Like a stick; there was no calf to be seen.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He well knew how to keep a granary and a storage bin;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There was no auditor who could earn anything (by catching him).<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He well knew by the drought and by the rain<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(What would be) the yield of his seed and of his grain.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;His lord's sheep, his cattle, his herd of dairy cows,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;His swine, his horses, his livestock, and his poultry<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Was wholly in this Reeve's control,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And in accord with his contract he gave the reckoning,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Since his lord was twenty years of age.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There was no man who could find him in arrears.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There was no farm manager, nor herdsman, nor other servant,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Whose trickery and treachery he did not know;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;They were afraid of him as of the plague.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;His dwelling was very nicely situated upon an heath;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;His place was shaded by green trees.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He could buy property better than his lord could.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He was secretly very richly provided.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He well knew how to please his lord subtly,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;By giving and lending him some of his lord's own possessions,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And have thanks, and also a coat and hood (as a reward).<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In youth he had learned a good craft:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He was a very good craftsman, a carpenter.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This Reeve sat upon a very good horse<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That was all dapple gray and was called Scot.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He had on a long outer coat of dark blue,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And by his side he wore a rusty sword.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Of Northfolk was this Reeve of whom I tell,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Near to a town men call Bawdeswelle.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He had his coat hitched up and belted, like a friar,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And ever he rode as the last of our company.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There was a SUMMONER with us in that place,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Who had a fire-red cherubim's face,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For it was pimpled and discolored, with swollen eyelids.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He was as hot and lecherous as a sparrow,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With black, scabby brows and a beard with hair fallen out.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Children were afraid of his face.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There was no mercury, lead monoxide, nor sulphur,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Borax, white lead, nor any oil of tarter,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nor ointment that would cleanse and burn,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That could cure him of his white pustules,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nor of the knobs sitting on his cheeks.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He well loved garlic, onions, and also leeks,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And to drink strong wine, red as blood;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Then he would speak and cry out as if he were crazy.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And when he had drunk deeply of the wine,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Then he would speak no word but Latin.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He had a few legal terms, two or three,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That he had learned out of some text of ecclesiastical law --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That is no wonder, he heard it all the day;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And also you know well how a jay<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Can call out "Walter" as well as the pope can.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But whoever knew how to examine him in other matters,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(Would find that) he had used up all his learning;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Always "The question is, what point of the law applies?" he would cry.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He was a fine rascal and a kind one;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;One could not find a better fellow.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For a quart of wine he would allow<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A good fellow to have his concubine<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For twelve months, and excuse him completely;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Secretly he also knew how to pull off a clever trick.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And if he found anywhere a good fellow,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He would teach him to have no awe<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Of the archdeacon's curse (of excommunication) in such a case,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Unless a man's soul were in his purse;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For in his purse he would be punished.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Purse is the archdeacon's hell," he said.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But well I know he lied right certainly;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Each guilty man ought to be afraid of excommunication,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For excommunication will slay just as forgiveness saves,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And let him also beware of a Significavit (order for imprisonment).<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In his control he had as he pleased<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The young people of the diocese,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And knew their secrets, and was the adviser of them all.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He had set a garland upon his heed,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As large as if it were for the sign of a tavern<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He had made himself a shield of a cake.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With him there rode a fine PARDONER<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Of Rouncivale, his friend and his companion,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Who had come straight from the court of Rome.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Very loud he sang "Come hither, love, to me!"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This Summoner harmonized with him in a strong bass;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There was never a trumpet of half so great a sound.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This Pardoner had hair as yellow as wax,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But smooth it hung as does a clump of flax;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;By small strands hung such locks as he had,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And he spread them over his shoulders;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But thin it lay, by strands one by one.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But to make an attractive appearance, he wore no hood,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For it was trussed up in his knapsack.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It seemed to him that he rode in the very latest style;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With hair unbound, save for his cap, he rode all bare-headed.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He had glaring eyes such as has a hare.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He had sewn a Veronica upon his cap.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Before him in his lap, (he had) his knapsack, <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Brimful of pardons come all fresh from Rome.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He had a voice as small as a goat has.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He had no beard, nor never would have;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It (his face) was as smooth as if it were recently shaven.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I believe he was a eunuch or a homosexual.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But as to his craft, from Berwick to Ware<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There was no other pardoner like him.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For in his pouch he had a pillow-case,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Which he said was Our Lady's veil;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He said he had a piece of the sail<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That Saint Peter had, when he went<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Upon the sea, until Jesus Christ took him.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He had a cross of latten (brass-like alloy) covered with stones,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And in a glass container he had pigs' bones.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But with these relics, when he found<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A poor parson dwelling in the countryside,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In one day he got himself more money<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Than the parson got in two months;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And thus, with feigned flattery and tricks,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He made fools of the parson and the people.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But truly to tell at the last,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He was in church a noble ecclesiast.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He well knew how to read a lesson or a story,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But best of all he sang an Offertory;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For he knew well, when that song was sung,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He must preach and well smooth his speech<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To win silver, as he very well knew how; <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Therefore he sang the more merrily and loud.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Now have I told you truly, briefly,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The rank, the dress, the number, and also the cause<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Why this company was assembled <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In Southwark at this fine hostelry<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That is called the Tabard, close by the Bell.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But now it is time to tell to you <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;How we conducted ourselves that same night,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When we had arrived in that hostelry;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And after that I will tell of our journey<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And all the rest of our pilgrimage.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But first I pray yow, of your courtesy,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That you do not attribute it to my rudeness,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Though I speak plainly in this matter,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To tell you their words and their behavior,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nor though I speak their words accurately.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For this you know as well as I:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Whoever must repeat a story after someone,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He must repeat as closely as ever he knows how<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Every single word, if it be in his power,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Although he may speak ever so rudely and freely,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Or else he must tell his tale inaccurately,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Or make up things, or find new words.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He may not refrain from (telling the truth), although he were his brother;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He must as well say one word as another.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Christ himself spoke very plainly in holy writ,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And you know well it is no rudeness.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Also Plato says, whosoever knows how to read him,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The words must be closely related to the deed.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Also I pray you to forgive it to me,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Although I have not set folk in order of their rank<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Here in this tale, as they should stand.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;My wit is short, you can well understand.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Our Host made great hospitality to everyone of us,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And to the supper he set us straightway.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He served us with victuals of the best sort;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The wine was strong, and it well pleased us to drink.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;OUR HOST was an impressive man indeed<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(Qualified) to be a master of ceremonies in a hall.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He was a large man with prominent eyes --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There was no better business man in Cheapside --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Bold of his speech, and wise, and well mannered,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And he lacked nothing at all of the qualities proper to a man.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Also moreover he was a right merry man;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And after supper he began to be merry,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And spoke of mirth among other things,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When we had paid our bills,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And said thus: "Now, gentlemen, truly,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;You are right heartily welcome to me;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For by my word, if I shall not lie (I must say),<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I saw not this year so merry a company<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;At one time in this lodging as is (here) now.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I would gladly make you happy, if I knew how.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And I have just now thought of an amusement,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To give you pleasure, and it shall cost nothing.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"You go to Canterbury -- God give you success,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;May the blessed martyr give you your reward!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And well I know, as you go by the way,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;You intend to tell tales and to amuse yourselves;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For truly, it is no comfort nor mirth<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To ride by the way dumb as a stone;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And therefore I will make a game for you,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As I said before, and provide you some pleasure.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And if pleases you all unanimously<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To be subject to my judgment,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And to do as I shall tell you,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Tomorrow, when you ride by the way,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Now, by the soul of my father who is dead,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Unless you be merry, I will give you my head!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Hold up your hands, without more speech."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Our decision was not long to seek out.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It seemed to us it was not worthwhile to deliberate on it,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And (we) granted his request without more discussion,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And asked him to say his decision as it pleased him.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Gentlemen," said he, "now listen for the best course of action;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But, I pray yow, do not take it in disdain (scorn it).<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This is the point, to speak briefly and clearly,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That each of yow, to make our way seem short by this means,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Must tell two tales in this journey<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;On the way to Canterbury, that is what I mean,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And on the homeward trip he shall tell two others,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;About adventures that in old times have happened.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And whoever of you who does best of all --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That is to say, who tells in this case<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Tales of best moral meaning and most pleasure --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Shall have a supper at the cost of us all<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Here in this place, sitting by this post,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When we come back from Canterbury.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And to make you the more merry,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I will myself gladly ride with you,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Entirely at my own cost, and be your guide;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And whosoever will not accept my judgment <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Shall pay all that we spend by the way.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And if you grant that it be so,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Tell me straightway, without more words,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And I will get ready early for this."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This thing was granted, and our oaths sworn<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With very glad hearts, and (we) prayed him also<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That he would consent to do so,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And that he would be our governor,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And judge and score keeper of our tales,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And set a supper at a certain price,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And we will be ruled as he wishes<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In every respect; and thus unanimously<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We are accorded to his judgment.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And thereupon the wine was fetched immediately;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We drank, and each one went to rest,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Without any longer tarrying.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In the morning, when day began to spring,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Our Host arose, and was the rooster of us all (awakened us).<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And gathered us together all in a flock,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And forth we rode at little more than a walk<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Unto the Watering of Saint Thomas;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And there our Host stopped his horse<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And said, "Gentlemen, listen, if you please.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;You know your agreement, and I remind you of it.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;If what you said last night agrees with what you say this morning, <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Let's see now who shall tell the first tale.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As ever I may drink wine or ale,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Whosoever may be rebel to my judgment<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Shall pay for all that is spent by the way.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Now draw straws, before we depart further (from London);<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He who has the shortest shall begin.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Sir Knight," said he, "my master and my lord,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Now draw a straw, for that is my decision.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Come nearer," he said, "my lady Prioress.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And you, sir Clerk, let be your modesty,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And study not; lay hand to (draw a straw), every man!"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Every person began straightway to draw,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And shortly to tell as it was,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Were it by chance, or destiny, or luck,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The truth is this: the draw fell to the Knight,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For which everyone was very happy and glad,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And he must tell his tale, as was reasonable,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;By our previous promise and by formal agreement,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As you have heard; what more words are needed?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And when this good man saw that it was so,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Like one who was wise and obedient<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To keep his agreement by his free assent,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He said, "Since I must begin the game,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;What! Welcome be the draw, in God's name!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Now let us ride, and listen to what I say."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And with that word we rode forth on our way,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And he began with a truly merry demeanor<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <nobr>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To tell his tale straightway, and said as you may hear.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When the Knight had thus told his tale,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In all the company there was no one young nor old<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who did not say it was a noble story<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And worthy to draw into memory,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And especially the gentlefolk every one.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Our Host laughed and swore, "As I may move about (I swear),<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This goes well; the bag is opened.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Let's see now who shall tell another tale;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For truly the game is well begun.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Now tell you, sir Monk, if you can,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Something to equal the Knight's tale."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Miller, who for drunkenness was all pale,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So that he hardly sat upon his horse,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He would not doff neither hood nor hat,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Nor give preference to any man out of courtesy,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But in Pilate's voice he began to cry,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And swore, "By (Christ's) arms, and by blood and bones,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I know a noble tale for this occasion,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With which I will now requite the Knight's tale."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Our Host saw that he was drunk on ale,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And said, "Wait, Robin, my dear brother;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Some better man shall first tell us another.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Wait, and let us act properly."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "By God's soul," said he, "that will not I;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For I will speak or else go my way."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Our Host answered, "Tell on, in the devil's name!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thou art a fool; thy wit is overcome."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Now listen," said the Miller, "everyone!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But first I make a protestation<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That I am drunk; I know it by my sound.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And therefore if that I misspeak or say (amiss),<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Blame it on ale of Southwerk, I you pray.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For I will tell a legend and a life<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Both of a carpenter and of his wife,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; How a clerk has set the carpenter's cap (fooled him)."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Reeve answered and said, "Hold your tongue!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Let be thy ignorant drunken ribaldry.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It is a sin and also a great folly<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To slander any man, or defame him,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And also to bring wives in such ill fame.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thou canst say enough about other things."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This drunken Miller spoke very quickly in reply<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And said, "Dear brother Oswald,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He who has no wife, he is no cuckold.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But I say not therefore that thou art one;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There are very good wives, many a one,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And ever a thousand good against one bad.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thou knowest that well thyself, unless thou art mad.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Why art thou angry with my tale now?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I have a wife, by God, as well as thou;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Yet I would not, for the oxen in my plow,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Take upon me more than enough (trouble),<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As to believe of myself that I were one (a cuckold);<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I will believe well that I am not one.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A husband must not be inquisitive<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of God's secrets, nor of his wife.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So long as he can find God's plenty there,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of the rest he needs not enquire."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What more should I say, but this Miller<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He would not refrain from speaking for any man,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But told his churl's tale in his manner.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I regret that I must repeat it here.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And therefore every respectable person I pray,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For God's love, think not that I speak<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Out of evil intention, but because I must repeat<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; All their tales, be they better or worse,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or else (I must) falsify some of my material.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And therefore, whoever does not want to hear it,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Turn over the leaf and choose another tale;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For he shall find enough, of every sort,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of historical matter that concerns nobility,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And also morality and holiness.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Blame not me if you choose amiss.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Miller is a churl; you know this well.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So was the Reeve also and many others,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And ribaldry they told, both of the two.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Think about this, and don't blame me;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And also people should not take a joke too seriously.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There was once dwelling at Oxford<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A rich churl, who took in boarders,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And of his craft he was a carpenter.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With him there was dwelling a poor scholar,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who had learned the arts curriculum, but all his desire<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Was turned to learning astrology,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And he knew a certain (number of) of astronomical operations,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To determine by scientific calculations,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If men asked him, in specific (astronomical) hours<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When men should have drought or else showers,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or if people asked him what should happen<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Concerning every thing; I can not reckon them all.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This clerk was called clever Nicholas.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of secret love he knew and of its satisfaction;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And moreover he was sly and very discreet,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And like a maiden meek in appearance.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A room had he in that hostelry<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Alone, without any company,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Very elegantly strewn with sweet-smelling herbs;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And he himself as sweet as is the root<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of licorice or any zedoary (a ginger-like herb).<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His Almagest, and books large and small,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His astrolabe, belonging to his art (of astronomy),<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His counting stones (for his abacus) lie neatly apart,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Arranged on shelves at his bed's head;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His linen press covered with a red woolen cloth;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And all above there lay a fine psaltery,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; On which at night he made melody<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So sweetly that all the room rang;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And "The Angel to the Virgin" he sang;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And after that he sang the King's Tune.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Very often his merry throat was blessed.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And thus this sweet clerk spent his time <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Living on his friends' support and his (own) income.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This carpenter had recently wedded a wife,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Whom he loved more than his life;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She was eighteen years of age.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Jealous he was, and held her narrowly in confinement,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For she was wild and young, and he was old<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And believed himself likely to be a cuckold.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He knew not Cato, for his wit was rude,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who advised that man should wed his equal.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Men should wed according to their status in life,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For youth and old age are often in conflict.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But since he was fallen in the snare,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He must endure, like other folk, his troubles.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Fair was this young wife, and moreover<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As any weasel was her body graceful and slender.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A belt she wore, with decorative strips all of silk,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; An apron as white as morning milk<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Upon her loins, full of many a flounce.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; White was her smock, and embroidered all in front<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And also behind, around her collar,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With coal-black silk, within and also without.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The ribbons of her white cap<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Were of the same color as her collar;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Her headband broad of silk, and set very high.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And surely she had a wanton eye;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Her two eyebrows were plucked very thin,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And those were bent and black as any sloe.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She was much more blissful to look upon<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Than is the new early-ripe pear tree,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And softer than the wool is of a sheep.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And by her girdle hung a purse of leather,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Tasseled with silk and ornamented with latten "pearls."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In all this world, to seek up and down,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There is no man so wise that he could imagine<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So lovely a little doll or such a wench.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Much brighter was the shining of her complexion<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Than the newly minted noble in the Tower.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But of her song, it was as loud and lively<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As any swallow sitting on a barn.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Moreover she could skip and play,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Like any kid or calf following its mother.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Her mouth was sweet as ale and honey or mead,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or a hoard of apples laid in hay or heather.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Skittish she was, as is a spirited colt,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Tall as a mast, and straight as an arrow.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A brooch she wore upon her low collar,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As broad as is the boss of a shield.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Her shoes were laced high on her legs.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She was a primrose, a pig's eye (a flower),<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For any lord to lay in his bed,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or yet for any good yeoman to wed.   <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Now, sir, and again, sir, it so happened<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That one day this clever Nicholas<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Happened with this young wife to flirt and play,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; While her husband was at Oseneye,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For clerks are very subtle and very clever;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And intimately he caught her by her crotch,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And said, "Indeed, unless I have my will,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For secret love of thee, sweetheart, I die."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And held her hard by the thigh,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And said, "Sweetheart, love me immediately<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or I will die, so save me God!"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And she sprang as a colt does when restrained,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And with her head she twisted fast away,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And said, "I will not kiss thee, by my faith!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Why, let me be!" said she. "Let me be, Nicholas,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or I will cry `out, help' and `alas'!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Take away your hands, for your courtesy!"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This Nicholas began to cry for mercy,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And spoke so fair, and pressed his suit so fast,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That she granted him her love at the last,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And swore her oath, by Saint Thomas of Kent,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That she will be at his commandment,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When she may well espy her opportunity.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "My husband is so full of jealousy<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That unless you wait patiently and are secretive,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I know right well I am as good as dead," said she.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "You must been very secret in this matter."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "No, care thee not about that," said Nicholas.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "A clerk had badly wasted his time (studying),<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If he could not outwit a carpenter."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And thus they are agreed and sworn<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To wait for a time, as I have told before.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When Nicholas had done thus every bit<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And well patted her about the loins,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He kissed her sweetly and takes his psaltery,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And plays fast, and makes melody.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Then it thus happened, that to the parish church,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Christ's own works to do,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This good wife went on a holiday.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Her forehead shone as bright as any day,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It was so washed when she left her work.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Now was there of that church a parish clerk,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who was called Absolon.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Curly was his hair, and as the gold it shone,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And stretched out like a fan large and broad;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Very straight and even lay his elegant parted hair.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His complexion was ruddy, his eyes gray as a goose.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With St. Paul's window carved on his shoes,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In red hose he went elegantly.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Clad he was very trimly and properly<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; All in a tunic of a light blue;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Very fair and thick are the laces set.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And over that he had a gay surplice<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As white as is the blossom upon the branch.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A merry lad he was, so save me God.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Well could he draw blood, and cut hair and shave,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And make a charter of land or a legal release. <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In twenty different ways could he trip and dance<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; After the school of Oxford as it was then,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And with his legs kick to and fro,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And play songs on a small fiddle,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To which he some times sang a loud high treble;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And he could play as well on a guitar.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In all the town there was no brew house nor tavern<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That he did not visit with his entertainment,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Where any merry barmaid was.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But to say the truth, he was somewhat squeamish<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; About farting, and fastidious in his speech.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This Absolon, who was elegant and gay,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Goes with a censer on the holiday,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Censing the wives of the parish eagerly;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And many a lovely look he cast on them,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And especially on this carpenter's wife.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To look on her he thought a merry life,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She was so attractive and sweet and flirtatious.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I dare well say, if she had been a mouse,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And he a cat, he would have grabbed her at once.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This parish clerk, this elegant Absolon,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Has in his heart such a love-longing<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That of no wife took he any offering;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For courtesy, he said, he would have none.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The moon, when it was night, very brightly shone,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And Absolon his guitar has taken;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For the sake of love he intended to stay awake.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And forth he goes, elegant and amorous,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Until he came to the carpenter's house<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A little after cocks had crowed,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And took his place up by a casement window<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That was upon the carpenter's wall.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He sings in his voice gentle and high,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Now, dear lady, if it be thy will,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I pray yow that you will have pity on me,"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Very well in harmony with his guitar-playing.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This carpenter awoke, and heard him sing,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And spoke unto his wife, and said at once,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "What! Alison! Hearest thou not Absolon,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That chants thus next to our bedroom's wall?"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And she answered her husband immediately,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Yes indeed, God knows, John, I hear it every bit."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This goes on; what more would you have?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; From day to day this elegant Absolon<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So woos her that he is in a sorry state.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He stays awake all the night and all the day;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He combs his flowing locks, and dressed himself elegantly;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He woos her by go-betweens and agents,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And swore he would be her own servant;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He sings, trilling like a nightingale;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He sent her sweetened wine, mead, and spiced ale,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And wafers, piping hot out of the fire;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And, because she was a townie, he offered money;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For some folk will be won for riches,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And some by force, and some for noble character.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Sometimes, to show his agility and skill,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He plays Herod upon a high stage.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But what good does it do him in this case?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She so loves this clever Nicholas<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That Absolon may go whistle;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He had for his labor nothing but scorn.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And thus she makes Absolon her fool,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And turns all his earnestness into a joke.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Very true is this proverb, it is no lie,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Men say right thus: "Always the nearby sly one<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Makes the distant loved one to be disliked."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For though Absolon be crazed or angry,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Because he was far from her sight,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This nearby Nicholas cast him in the shadow.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Now bear thyself well, thou clever Nicholas,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For Absolon may wail and sing "alas."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And so it happened on a Saturday,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This carpenter was gone to Osenay;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And clever Nicholas and Alisoun<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Are agreed on this plan,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That Nicholas shall devise a trick<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To beguile this hapless jealous husband;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And if it so be the game went right,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She should sleep in his arms all night,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For this was his desire and hers also.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And right away, without more words,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This Nicholas no longer would tarry,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But has carried very quietly unto his chamber<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Both food and drink for a day or two,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And told her to say to her husband,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If he asked about Nicholas,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She should say she knew not where he was;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of all that day she saw him not with eye;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She believed that he was ill,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Because, for no shout could her maid call him,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He would not answer for anything that might befall.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This goes on all that same Saturday,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That Nicholas still in his chamber lay,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And ate and slept, or did what he pleased,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Until Sunday, when the sun goes to rest.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This hapless carpenter has great marvel<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; About Nicholas, or what thing might ail him,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And said, "I am afraid, by Saint Thomas,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Things are not right with Nicholas.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; God forbid that he should suddenly die!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This world is now very ticklish, surely.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I saw today a corpse carried to church<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That just now, on last Monday, I saw him work.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Go up," he said unto his servant at once,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Call at his door, or knock with a stone.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Look how it is, and tell me quickly."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This servant goes up very resolutely,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And at the chamber door while he stood,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He cried and knocked as if he were crazy,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "What, hey! What do you, master Nicholay?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; How can you sleep all the long day?"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But all for naught; he heard not a word.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He found a hole, very low upon a board,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Where the cat was accustomed to creep in,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And through that hole he looked in very carefully,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And at the last he had a sight of him.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This Nicholas sat ever gaping upward,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As if he were gazing on the new moon.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Down he goes, and told his master immediately<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In what condition he saw this same man.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This carpenter began to bless himself,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And said, "Help us, Saint Frideswide!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A man knows little what shall happen to him.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This man is fallen, because of his astronomy,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In some madness or in some fit.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I always thought well how it should be!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Men should not know of God's secrets.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Yes, blessed be always an unlearned man<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who knows nothing but only his belief!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So fared another clerk with astronomy;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He walked in the fields to look <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Upon the stars, (to find) there what should happen,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Until he was fallen in a fertilizer pit;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He did not see that. But yet, by Saint Thomas,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I feel very sorry for clever Nicholas.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He shall be scolded for his studying,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If that I may, by Jesus, heaven's king!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Get me a staff, that I may pry up from below,   <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; While thou, Robyn, lift up the door.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He shall (come) out of his studying, as I guess."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And to the chamber door he turned his attention.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His servant was a strong fellow for this purpose,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And by the hasp he heaved it off at once;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Onto the floor the door fell straightway.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This Nicholas sat ever as still as stone,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And ever gaped upward into the air.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This carpenter supposed he was in despair,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And seized him by the shoulders vigorously,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And shook him hard, and cried loudly,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "What! Nicholay! What, how! What, look down!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Awake, and think on Christ's passion!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I bless thee from elves and from evil creatures."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Therewith the night-charm he said straightway<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; On four corners of the house about,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And on the threshold of the door outside:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Jesus Christ and Saint Benedict,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Bless this house from every wicked creature,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For evil spirits of the nights, the white pater-noster!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Where went thou, Saint Peter's sister?"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And at the last this clever Nicholas<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Began to sigh deeply, and said, "Alas!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Shall all the world be lost right now?"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This carpenter answered, "What sayest thou?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What! Think on God, as we do, men who work."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This Nicholas answered, "Fetch me drink,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And after will I speak in private<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; About a certain matter that concerns me and thee.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I will tell it to no other man, certainly."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This carpenter goes down, and comes again,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And brought of strong ale a large quart;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And when each of them had drunk his part,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This Nicholas shut fast his door,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And the carpenter sat down by him.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He said, "John, my host, beloved and dear,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thou shalt upon thy pledged word swear to me here<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That to no person thou shalt this counsel reveal,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For it is Christ's secrets that I say,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And if thou tell it to anyone, thou art completely lost;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For this vengeance thou shalt have therefore,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That if thou betray me, thou shalt go mad."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Nay, Christ forbid it, for his holy blood!"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Said then this hapless man, "I am no blabbermouth,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And, though I say it, I do not like to gab.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Say what thou will, I shall never tell it <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To child nor wife, by Him that rescued souls from hell!"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Now John," said Nicholas, "I will not lie;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I have found in my astrology,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As I have looked on the bright moon,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That now on Monday next, after midnight,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Shall fall a rain, and that so wild and raging<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That Noah's flood was never half so large.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This world," he said, "in less than an hour<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Shall all be drowned, so hideous is the shower.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thus shall mankind drown, and lose their lives."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This carpenter answered, "Alas, my wife!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And shall she drown? Alas, my Alisoun!"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For sorrow of this he almost fell down,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And said, "Is there no remedy in this case?"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Why, yes indeed, by God," said clever Nicholas,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "If thou will act in accordance with learning and (good) advice.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thou mayst not act according to thine own ideas;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For thus says Salomon, which was very true:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; `Do all in accordance with good advice, and thou shalt not rue (it).'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And if thou will act in accordance with good advice,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I guarantee, without mast and sail,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Yet shall I save her and thee and me.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Hast thou not heard how Noah was saved,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When our Lord had warned him before<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That all the world should be destroyed by water?"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Yes indeed," said this Carpenter, "very long ago."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Hast thou not heard," said Nicholas, "also<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The sorrow of Noah with his fellowship,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Before he could get his wife onto the ship?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He would rather, I dare well guarantee,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; At that time, than have all his black sheep<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That she had had a ship for herself alone.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And therefore, knowest thou what is best to do?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This needs haste, and of a hasty thing<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Men may not preach nor make tarrying.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Right now go bring us quickly into this dwelling<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A kneading trough, or else a large vat,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For each of us, but see that they be large,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In which we may float as in a barge,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And have therein sufficient victuals<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But for a day -- fie on the remnant!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The water shall recede and go away<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; About nine a.m. on the next day.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But Robin, thy knave, may not know of this, <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And also thy maid Gille I can not save;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Ask not why, for though thou ask me,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I will not tell God's secrets.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It suffices thee, unless thy wits go mad,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To have as great a grace as Noah had.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thy wife shall I well save, beyond doubt.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Go now thy way, and speed thee on this business.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "But when thou hast, for her and thee and me,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Got us these three kneading tubs,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Then shalt thou hang them in the roof very high,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In a way that no man may espy our preparations.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And when thou thus hast done as I have said,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And hast laid our victuals carefully in them,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And also an axe to smite the cord in two,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When the water comes, so that we may go<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And break a hole on high, upon the gable,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Toward the garden, over the stable,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That we may freely pass forth on our way,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When the great shower is gone away.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Then shalt thou float as merry, I guarantee,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As does the white duck after her drake.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Then will I call, `How, Alison! How, John!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Be merry, for the flood will soon pass.'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And thou will say, `Hail, master Nicholay!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Good morrow, I see thee well, for it is day.'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And then shall we be lords all our life<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of all the world, like Noah and his wife.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "But of one thing I warn thee very sternly:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Be well advised on that same night<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; On which we are entered onto shipboard,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That not one of us speak a word,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Nor call, nor cry, but be in his prayer;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For it is God's own dear command.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Thy wife and thou must hang far apart,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So that between yow shall be no sin,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; No more in looking than there shall be in deed.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This ordinance is said. Go, God give thee success!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Tomorrow at night, when people are all asleep,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Into our kneading-tubs will we creep,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And sit there, awaiting God's grace.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Go now thy way; I have no more time<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To make of this any longer preaching.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Men say thus, `send the wise, and say nothing.'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thou art so wise, one needs not teach thee.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Go, save our life, and that I beseech thee."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This hapless carpenter goes forth his way.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Very often he said "Alas and woe is me,"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And to his wife he told his secret,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And she was aware, and knew it better than he,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What all this ingenious scheme meant.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But nonetheless she acted as if she would die,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And said, "Alas! go forth thy way quickly,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Help us to escape, or we are dead each one of us!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I am thy faithful, truly wedded wife;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Go, dear spouse, and help to save our lives."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Lo, what a great thing is emotion!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; One can die of imagination,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So deeply may a mental image be taken.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This hapless carpenter begins to tremble;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He thinks truly that he can see<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Noah's flood come surging like the sea<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To drown Alisoun, his honey dear.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He weeps, wails, looks wretched;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He sighs with very many a sorry groan;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He goes and gets him a kneading trough,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And after that a tub and a large vat,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And secretly he sent them to his dwelling,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And hanged them in the roof secretly.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With his own hand he made three ladders,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To climb by the rungs and the uprights<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Unto the tubs hanging in the beams,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And provisioned them, both trough and tub,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With bread, and cheese, and good ale in a jug,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Sufficing just enough for a day.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But before he had made all this preparation,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He sent his servant, and also his servant girl,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Upon his business to go to London.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And on the Monday, when it drew toward night,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He shut his door without candlelight,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And prepared everything as it should be.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And shortly, up they climbed all three;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They sat still a good two and one-half minutes.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Now, Pater-noster, quiet!" said Nicholay,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And "Quiet!" said John, and "Quiet!" said Alisoun.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This carpenter said his devotion,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And still he sits, and says his prayer,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Awaiting the rain, if he might hear it.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The dead sleep, for weary business,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Fell on this carpenter right, as I guess,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; About curfew time, or a little more;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For suffering of his spirit he groans deeply,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And also he snores, for his head lay wrong.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Down on the ladder stalks Nicholay,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And Alisoun very quietly down she sped;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Without more words they go to bed,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Where the carpenter is accustomed to lie.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There was the revel and the sounds of festivity;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And thus lie Alison and Nicholas,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In business of mirth and of pleasure,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Until the bell of the early morning service began to ring,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And friars in the chapel began to sing.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This parish clerk, this amorous Absolon,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That is for love always so woebegone,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Upon the Monday was at Oseneye<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With company, to be merry and amuse himself,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And by chance asked a cloistered monk<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Very discreetly about John the carpenter;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And he drew him apart out of the church,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And said, "I know not; I have not seen him working here<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Since Saturday; I suppose that he is gone<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For timber, where our abbot has sent him;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For he is accustomed to go for timber <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And dwell at the granary a day or two;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or else he is at his house, certainly.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Where he may be, I can not truly say."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This Absolon very was jolly and happy,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And thought, "Now is time to stay awake all night,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For surely I saw him not stirring<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; About his door, since day began to spring.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "As I may prosper, I shall, at cock's crow,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Very quietly knock at his window<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That stands very low upon his bedroom's wall.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To Alison now I will tell all<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; My love-longing, for yet I shall not miss<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That at the very least I shall her kiss.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Some sort of comfort shall I have, by my faith.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; My mouth has itched all this long day;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That is a sign of kissing at the least.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; All night I dreamed also I was at a feast.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Therefore I will go sleep an hour or two,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And all the night then will I stay awake and play."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When the first cock has crowed (about midnight), at once<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Up rises this elegant lover Absolon,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And dresses himself handsomely, in every detail.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But first he chews cardamom and licorice,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To smell sweet, ere he had combed his hair.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Under his tongue he had a true-love herb,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For thus he thought he would be gracious.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He goes to the carpenter's house,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And he stands still under the casement window --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Unto his breast it reached, it was so low --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And softly he coughs with a gentle sound:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "What do you, honey-comb, sweet Alisoun,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; My fair bird, my sweet cinnamon?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Awake, sweetheart mine, and speak to me!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Well little you think upon my woe,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That for your love I sweat wherever I go.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; No wonder is though that I swelter and sweat;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I mourn as does a lamb after the tit.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Indeed, sweetheart, I have such love-longing<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That like a true turtledove is my mourning.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I can eat no more than a maiden."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Go from the window, you idiot," she said;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "So help me God, it will not be `come kiss me.'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I love another -- and else I were to blame --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Well better than thee, by Jesus, Absolon.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Go forth thy way, or I will cast a stone,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And let me sleep, in the name of twenty devils!"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Alas," said Absolon, "and woe is me,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That true love was ever in such miserable circumstances!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Then kiss me, since it can be no better,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For Jesus' love, and for the love of me."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Wilt thou then go thy way with that?" said she.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Yes, certainly, sweetheart," said this Absolon.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Then make thee ready," said she, "I come right now." <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And unto Nicholas she said quietly,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Now hush, and thou shalt laugh all thy fill."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This Absolon set himself down on his knees<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And said, "I am a lord in every way;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For after this I hope there comes more.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Sweetheart, thy grace, and sweet bird, thy mercy!"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The window she undoes, and that in haste.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Get done with it," said she, "come on, and hurry up,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Lest our neighbors espy thee."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This Absolon wiped his mouth very dry.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Dark was the night as pitch, or as the coal,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And at the window out she put her hole,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And Absolon, to him it happened no better nor worse,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But with his mouth he kissed her naked ass<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With great relish, before he was aware of this.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Back he jumped, and thought it was amiss,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For well he knew a woman has no beard.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He felt a thing all rough and long haired,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And said, "Fie! alas! what have I done?"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Tehee!" said she, and clapped the window to,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And Absolon goes forth walking sadly.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "A beard! A beard!" said clever Nicholas,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "By God's body, this goes fair and well."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This hapless Absolon heard every bit,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And on his lip he began for anger to bite,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And to himself he said, "I shall pay thee back." <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who rubs now, who now scrubs his lips<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With dust, with sand, with straw, with cloth, with chips,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But Absolon, who says very often, "Alas!"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "My soul I entrust to Satan,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If I would not rather than (have) all this town," said he,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Be avenged for this insult.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Alas," said he, "alas, I did not turn away!"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His hot love was cold and all extinguished;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For from that time that he had kissed her ass,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Love-making he thought not worth not a watercress,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For he was healed of his malady.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Very often he did renounce love-making,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And wept as does a child that is beaten.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; At a slow pace he went down the street<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To a smith men called dan Gerveys,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who in his forge made plowing equipment; <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He sharpens ploughshares and plough blades busily.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This Absolon knocked all gently,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And said, "Open up, Gerveys, and that right now."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "What, who art thou?" "It am I, Absolon."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "What, Absolon! for Christ's sweet cross,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Why rise you so early? Ay, bless me!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What ails yow? Some pretty girl, God knows it,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Hath brought you to be running around  like this.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; By Saint Note, you know well what I mean."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This Absolon cared not a bean<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For all his joking; no word he gave in reply;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He had more business on hand <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Than Gerveys knew, and said, "Friend so dear,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That hot plough blade in the hearth here,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Lend it to me; I have something to do with it,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And I will bring it back to thee very soon."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Gerveys answered, "Certainly, were it gold,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or in a sack countless silver coins,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thou sholdest have it, as I am true smith.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Ay, Christ's foe! What will you do with it?"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Concerning that," said Absolon, "be as be may.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I shall well tell it to thee to-morrow" --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And caught the plough blade by the cold handle.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Very softly out at the door he began to steal,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And went unto the carpenter's wall.   <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He coughs first, and knocks then<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Upon the window, just as he did before.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This Alison answered, "Who is there<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That knocks so? I swear it is a thief."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Why, nay," said he, "God knows, my sweet beloved,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I am thy Absolon, my darling.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of gold," said he, "I have brought thee a ring.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; My mother gave it to me, as God may save me;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Very fine it is, and also nicely engraved.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This will I give thee, if thou kiss me."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This Nicholas was risen to piss,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And thought he would make the joke even better;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He should kiss his ass before he escapes.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And he opened up the window hastily,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And he puts out his ass stealthily<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Over the buttock, to the thigh;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And then spoke this clerk, this Absolon,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Speak, sweet bird, I know not where thou art."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This Nicholas immediately let fly a fart<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As great as if it had been a thunder-bolt,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So that with the stroke he was almost blinded;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And he was ready with his hot iron,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And he smote Nicholas in the middle of the ass.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Off goes the skin a hand's breadth about,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The hot plough blade so burned his rump<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And for the pain he thought he would die.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As if he were crazy, for woe he began to cry,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Help! Water! Water! Help, for God's heart!"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This carpenter woke suddenly out of his slumber,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And heard someone cry "water!" as if he were crazy,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And thought, "Alas, now comes Nowell's flood!"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He sits up without more words,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And with his ax he smote the cord in two,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And down goes all; he found nothing to sell (wasted no time),<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Neither bread nor ale, until he came to the pavement<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Upon the floor, and there he lay in a swoon.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Up started Alison and Nicholay,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And cried "Out" and "Help" in the street.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The neighbors, both low-ranking and high,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Run in to gawk at this man,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who yet lay in a swoon, both pale and wan,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For with the fall he had broken his arm.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But he had to stand up for himself, though it went badly;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For when he spoke, he was immediately put down<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; By clever Nicholas and Alisoun.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They told every one that he was crazy;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He was so afraid of Nowell's flood<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Because of his imagination that in his foolishness<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He had bought himself three kneading tubs,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And had hanged them in the roof above;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And that he begged them, for God's love,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To sit in the roof, to keep him company.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The folk did laugh at his foolishness;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Into the roof they stare and they gape,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And turned all his harm into a joke.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For whatever this carpenter answered,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It was for naught; no one listened to his explanation,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With oaths great he was so sworn down<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That he was considered crazy in all the town;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For every clerk immediately agreed with the other.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They said, "The man is crazy, my dear brother";<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And every person did laugh at this strife.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thus screwed was this carpenter's wife,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In spite of all his guarding and his jealousy,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And Absolon has kissed her lower eye,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And Nicholas is scalded in the rump.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This tale is done, and God save all this company!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A young man called Melibeus, mighty and rich, begot upon his wife, who was called Prudence,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a daughter who was called Sophie.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Upon one day it happened that he for his pleasure went into the fields to amuse himself.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His wife and also his daughter has he left within his house of which the doors were tightly shut.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Three of his old foes have seen this, and set ladders to the walls of his house,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and by windows have entered,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and beat his wife, and wounded his daughter with five mortal wounds in five different places --<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; this is to say, in her feet, in her hands, in her ears, in her nose,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and in her mouth -- and left her for dead, and went away.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When Melibeus had returned into his house, and saw all this mischief, he,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; like a mad man tearing his clothes, began to weep and cry.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Prudence, his wife, insofar as she dared, besought him to stop his weeping. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; but nevertheless he began to cry and the longer he wept the more he wept.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This noble wife Prudence remembered the saying of Ovid, in his book<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; that is called the Remedy of Love, where he says<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "He is a fool that stops the mother from weeping on the death of her child<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; until she has wept her fill as for a certain time,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and then shall one do his best efforts with amiable words to comfort her,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;and pray her of her weeping to stint."</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For which reason this noble wife Prudence allowed her husband<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to weep and cry as for a certain amount of time,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and when she saw her opportunity, she said to him in this manner:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Alas, my lord," said she, "why do you make yourself to be like a fool?<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For truly it does not befit a wise man to make such a sorrow.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Your daughter, with the grace of God, shall recover and escape.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And, even if it were so that she right now were dead,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; you ought not, for her death, to destroy yourself.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Seneca says: `The wise man shall not take too great discomfort for the death of his children,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; but, certainly, he should suffer it in patience<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; as well as he abides the death of his own self.'"<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This Melibeus answered immediately and said, "What man," said he, "should stint of his weeping <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; who has such a good reason to weep?<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Jesus Christ, our Lord, himself wept for the death of Lazarus his friend."<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Prudence answered: "Certainly, I know well that moderate weeping is in no way forbidden to him who is sorrowful,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; amongst folk in sorrow, but it is rather granted to him to weep.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Apostle Paul unto the Romans writes, `One shall rejoice<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; with those who make joy and weep with such folk as weep.'<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But though moderate weeping is granted, excessive weeping certainly is forbidden.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Moderation in weeping should be considered in the light of the lore that Seneca teaches us:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; `When thy friend is dead,' said he, `let not thine eyes be too moist of tears,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; nor too much dry; although the tears come to thine eyes, let them not fall;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and when thou hast lost thy friend, make an effort to get another friend; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and this is more wisdom than to weep for thy friend<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; whom thou hast lost, for therein is no remedy.'<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And therefore, if you govern yourself by wisdom, put away sorrow out of your heart.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Remember you that Jesus son of Sirach says, `A man that is joyous and glad in heart,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; it conserves him flourishing in his age; but truly sorrowful heart makes his bones dry.'<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He says also thus, that sorrow in heart slays very many a man.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Solomon says that just as moths in the sheep's fleece do harm to the clothes,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and the small worms to the tree, just so sorrow does harm to the heart.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Wherefore we should, as well in the death of our children<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; as in the loss of our other earthly goods, have patience.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Remember the patient Job. When he had lost his children and his earthly property,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and in his body endured and received very many a grievous tribulation, yet said he thus:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; `Our Lord has given it to me; our Lord hath taken it from me; just as our Lord wished,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; just so it is done; blessed be the name of our Lord!'"<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To these foresaid things answered Melibeus unto his wife Prudence: "All thy words," said he, <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "are true and furthermore beneficial, but truly my heart is troubled with this sorrow<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; so grievously that I know not what to do."<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Have summoned," said Prudence, "all thy true friends and of thy family those that are wise. Tell your case,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and hearken what they say in advising, and govern yourself according to their advice." <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Solomon says, `Do all thy business by taking advice, and thou shalt never repent.'" <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Then, by the advice of his wife Prudence, this Melibeus had called up a great congregation of folk,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; such as surgeons, physicians, old folk and young, and some of his old enemies reconciled<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (as it seemed by their appearance) to his love and into his grace;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and therewithal there came some of his neighbors that did him reverence<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; more for dread than for love, as it often happens.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There came also very many subtle flatterers and wise advocates learned in the law.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And when this folk were assembled together, this Melibeus in sorrowful manner showed them his case.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And by the manner of his speech it seemed that in heart he bore a cruel anger,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ready to do vengeance upon his foes, and desired that the war should begin very soon;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; but nevertheless, yet he asked their advice upon this matter.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A surgeon, by permission and assent of such as were wise, stood up<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and to Melibeus said as you can hear:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Sir," said he, "as to us surgeons it is our duty that we do to every person the best that we can,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; where we are employed, and to our patients that we do no damage,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; because of which it happens many times and often that when two men have each one wounded the other,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; one same surgeon heals them both;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; therefore unto our art it is not fitting to nourish war nor to support warring factions. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But certainly, as to the curing of your daughter, although it be so that she is perilously wounded,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; we shall do such diligent work from day to night that with the grace of God<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; she shall be whole and sound as soon as is possible."<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Almost in just the same way the physicians answered, save that they said a few words more:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; that just as maladies are cured by their contraries, just so shall men cure war by vengeance.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His neighbors full of envy, his feigned friends that seemed reconciled, and his flatterers<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; made an outward show of weeping, and worsened and much aggravated this matter in praising<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; greatly Melibee of might, of power, of riches, and of friends, despising the power of his adversaries,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and said flatly that he immediately should avenge himself on his foes and begin war.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Up rose then an advocate that was wise,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; by leave and by advice of others that were wise, and said:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Gentlemen, the urgent matter for which we are assembled in this place<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; is a very serious thing and an important matter,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; because of the wrong and of the wickedness that has been done,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and also by reason of the great damages that in time coming<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; are possible to befall for this same cause,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and also because of the great riches and power of both the parties,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; for the which reasons it would be a very great peril to err in this matter.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Wherefore, Melibeus, this is our opinion: we advise you above all things <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; that right away thou do thy best efforts in keeping of thy own self in such a way<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; that thou not lack any spy nor guard in order to save thy person.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And after that, we advise that in thy house thou set sufficient garrison<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; so that they can defend as well thy body as thy house.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But certainly, to begin war, or suddenly to do vengeance, we can not decide<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; in so little time that it would be to our advantage.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Therefore we ask leisure and opportunity to have deliberation in this case to judge.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For the common proverb says thus: `He that soon judges, soon shall repent.'<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And also men say that that judge is wise fhat soon understands a matter and judges at leisure; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; for although it be so that all tarrying is bothersome, <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; it is not always to be reproved in giving of judgment nor in vengeance taking, <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; when it is sufficient and reasonable.  <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And that showed our Lord Jesus Christ by example, for when the woman that was taken in adultery<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; was brought in his presence to know what should be done with her person, although it be so that <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  he knew well hmself what he would answer, yet he would not answer suddenly,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; but he would have deliberation, and in the ground he wrote twice.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And by these causes we ask time for deliberation, and we shall then, by the grace of God, advise thee<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; something that shall be beneficial."<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Up jumped then the young folk at once, and the most part of that company have scorned this old wise man<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; man, and began to make noise, and said that<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; just so as while that iron is hot men should smite,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; just so men should avenge their wrongs while they are fresh and new;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and with loud voice they cried "War! War!"<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Up rose then one of these old wise men, and with his hand made signal that<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; men should hold themselves still and give him audience.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Gentlemen," said he, "there is very many a man that cries `War, war!'<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; who knows very little what war amounts to.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; War at its beginning has so big an entryway and so large that every person may enter<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; when he pleases and easily find war;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; but certainly what end that shall consequently befall, it is not easy to know.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For truly, when war is once begun, there is very many a child unborn of his mother<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; that shall die young because of that same war, or else live in sorrow and die in wretchedness.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And therefore, ere any war begin, men must have much advice and much deliberation."<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And when this old man intended to reinforce his argument by reasons, well nigh all at once they began <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to rise to interrupt his speech, and very often prayed him to abridge his argument.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For truly, he who preaches to those who do not want to hear his words, his sermon annoys them.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For Jesus son of Sirach says that "music in weeping is an annoying thing"; this is to say:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; it as much avails to speak before folk whom his speech annoys<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; as it is to sing before him who weeps.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And when this wise man saw that he lacked an audience, all shame-fast he set himself down again.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For Solomon says: "Where thou can not have any audience, force thyself not to speak."<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "I see well," said this wise man, "that the common proverb is true, that<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; `good advice is lacking when it is most needed.'"<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Yet had this Melibeus among his advisors many folk that secretly in his ear advised him on certain matters,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and advised him the contrary in the hearing of all.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When Melibeus had heard that the greatest part of his advisors were agreed that he should make war,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; immediately he consented to their advice and fully affirmed their opinion.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Then dame Prudence, when she saw how her husband prepared himself to avenge himself on his<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; foes and to begin war, she in very humble manner, when she saw her time, said to him these words:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "My lord," said she, "I beseech you, as heartily as I dare and can,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; do not hasten yourself too fast and, as you hope to prosper, give me a hearing.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For Petrus Alphonsus says, `Whoever does to thee either good or harm, hasten thee not to requite it,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; for in this manner thy friend will abide and thine enemy shall the longer live in dread.'<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The proverb says, `He hastens well that wisely can abide,' and `in wicked haste is no benefit.'"<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This Melibee answered unto his wife Prudence: "I do not intend," said he, "to work according to thy advice,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; for many causes and reasons. For certainly, every person would hold me then a fool;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; this is to say, if I, for thy advice, would change<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; things that are ordained and affirmed by so many wise men.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Secondly, I say that all women are wicked, and not one good of them all.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For `of a thousand men,' says Solomon, `I found one good man, but certainly,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of all women, a good woman found I never.'<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And also, certainly, if I governed myself according to thy advice,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; it should seem that I had given to thee the mastery over me,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and God forbid that it were so!<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For Jesus son of Sirach says that `if the wife have mastery, she is contrary to her husband.'<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And Solomon says: `Never in thy life to thy wife, nor to thy child, nor to thy friend<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; give any power over thyself, for it would be better that thy children<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ask of thy person things that they need than that thou see thyself<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; in the hands of thy children.'<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And also if I would work according to thy advice, certainly, my counsel must some times be secret,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; until it were time that it must be known, and this may not be.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When dame Prudence, very debonairly and with great patience, had heard all that her husband <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; was pleased to say, then she asked of him permission to speak, and said in this manner:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "My lord," said she, "as to your first reason, certainly it may easily be answered. For I say that<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; it is no folly to change one's plans when the situation is changed,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; or else when the matter seems other than it was before.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And moreover, I say that though you have sworn and promised to accomplish<br> 
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; performing that same undertaking for a good reason, men should not say therefore that you are a liar nor forsworn.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For the book says that `the wise man tells no lie when he turns his inclination to the better.'<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And although it be so that your undertaking is established and decided upon by a great multitude of folk,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; yet you need not carry out that plan unless you want to.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For the truth of things and the benefit are rather found in few folk that are wise and<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; full of reason than by a great multitude of folk where every man cries and babbles what he pleases.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Truly such a multitude is not honorable.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And as to the second reason, where you say that all women are wicked;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; with all due respect to you, certainly you despise all women in this manner, and<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; `he who despises all, displeases all,' as says the book.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And Seneca says that `whosoever will have wisdom shall no man disparage,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; but he shall gladly teach the knowledge that he knows without presumption or pride;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and such things of which he knows nothing, he should not be ashamed to learn them,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and ask for advice from lesser folk than himself.'<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And, sir, that there has been many a good woman may easily be proven.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For certainly, sir, our Lord Jesus Christ would never have condescended to be born of a woman,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; if all women had been wicked.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And after that, for the great goodness that is in women,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; our Lord Jesus Christ, when he was risen from death to life,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; appeared to a woman rather than to his Apostles.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And though Solomon says that he never found a good woman,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; it follows not therefore that all women are wicked.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For though he found no good woman, certainly,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; many another man has found many a woman very good and true.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or else, possibly, the intent of Solomon was this:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; that, in supreme goodness, he found no woman --<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; this is to say, that there is no creature who has supreme goodness save God alone,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; as he himself records in his Gospels.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For there is no creature so good that he does not lack<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; something of the perfection of God, who is his maker.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Your third reason is this: you say that if you govern yourself by my advice,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; it should seem that you had given me the mastery and the lordship over your person.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Sir, with all due respect to you, it is not so. For if it were true that no man should be advised<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; but only of them that had lordship and mastery of his person, men would not be advised so often.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For truly that man who asks advice about a plan, yet has free choice<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; whether he will follow by that advice or non.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And as to your fourth reason, where you say that the gossip of women can hide things that they<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; know not, as who says that a woman can not hide what she knows;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; sir, these words are understood of women that are gossips and wicked;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of which women men say that three things drive a man out of his house --<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; that is to say, smoke, dropping of rain, and wicked wives;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and of such women says Solomon that<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; `it were better dwell in desert than with a woman that is dissolute.'<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And sir, by your leave, that am not I,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; for you have very often tested my great silence and my great patience, and also how well that<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I can hide and conceal things that men ought secretly to hide.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And truly, as to your fifth reason, where you say that in wicked advice women vanquish men,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; God knows, that reason has no value here.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For understand now, you ask advice to do wickedness;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and if you will do wickedness, and your wife restrains that wicked purpose,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and overcomes you by reason and by good advice,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; certainly your wife ought rather to be praised than blamed.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thus should you understand the philosopher that says, `In wicked advice women vanquish their husbands.'<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And whereas you blame all women and their reasons, I shall show you by many examples that<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; many a woman has been very good, and yet are, and their advices very wholesome and beneficial.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Also some men have said that the counsel of women<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; is either too expensive or else too little of price.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But although it be so that very many a woman is bad and her advice vile and not worthy,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; yet have men found very many a good woman, and very discrete and wise in giving counsel.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Lo, Jacob by the good advice of his mother Rebecca won the blessing of Isaac his fader<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and the lordship over all his brethren.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Judith by her good advice delivered the city of Bethulia, in which she dwelled,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; out of the hands of Holofernus, who had besieged it and would have entirely destroyed it.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Abigail delivered Nabal her husband from David the king, who would have slain him,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and appeased the anger of the king by her wit and by her good advice.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Hester by her good counsel advanced greatly the people of God in the reign of Assuerus the king.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And the same goodness in good advising of many a good woman may men tell.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And moreover, when our Lord had created Adam, our forefather, he said in this manner:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; `It is not good to be a man alone; let us make for him a helpmate similar to himself.'<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Here may you see that if women were not good, and their advice good and beneficial,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; our Lord God of heaven would never have made them,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; nor called them help of man, but rather confusion of man.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And there said once a clerk in two verses, `What is better than gold? Jasper.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What is better than jasper? Wisdom.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And what is better than wisdom? Woman. And what is better than a good woman? Nothing.'<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And, sir, by many other reasons may you see that<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; many women are good, and their advice good and beneficial.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And therefore, sir, if you will trust to my advice, I shall restore you your daughter whole and sound.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And also I will do for you so much that you shall have honor in this undertaking."<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When Melibee had heard the words of his wife Prudence, he said thus:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "I see well that the word of Solomon is sooth.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He says that `words that are spoken discretely and properly are honeycombs,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; for they give sweetness to the soul and healthfulness to the body.'<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And, wife, because of thy sweet words, and also because I have tested and proven thy great wisdom <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and thy great truth, I will govern myself by thy advice in all things."<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Now, sir," said dame Prudence, "and since you consent to be governed by my advice,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I will inform you how you shall govern yourself in the choice of your advisors.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You shall first in all your works meekly beseech the high God that he will be your advisor;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and prepare yourself with the aim that he give you advice and comfort, as Tobias taught his son:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; `At all times thou shalt bless God, and pray him to prepare thy ways,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and look that all thy counsels are in him for evermore.'<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Saint James also says: `If any of you have need of wisdom, ask it of God.'<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And afterward then shall you take advice in yourself,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and examine well your thoughts of such thing as it seems to you best for your advantage. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And then shall you drive from your heart three things that are contrary to good advice;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; that is to say, anger, greed, and haste.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "First, he who asks advice of himself, certainly he must be without anger, for many reasons.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The first is this: he who has great anger and wrath in himself, he supposes always that<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; he can do a thing that he can not do.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And secondly, he who is angry and wrathful, he can not well judge;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and he who can not well judge, can not well advise.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The third is this, that he that is angry and wrathful, as says Seneca,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; can not speak anything but blameworthy things,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and with his vicious words he stirs other folk to anger and to ire.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And also, sir, you must drive greed out of your heart.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For the Apostle says that greed is root of all harms.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And trust well that a greedy man can neither judge nor think anything,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; except only to fulfill the object of his greed;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and certainly, that can never be accomplished,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; for always the more abundance that he has of riches, the more he desires.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And, sir, you must also drive out of your heart haste; for certainly,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; you can not judge for the best by a sudden thought that falls in your heart,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; but you must reflect upon it very often.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For, as you heard before this, the common proverb is this, that `he who soon judges, soon repents.'<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Sir, you are not always in the same frame of mind;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; for certainly, something that sometimes seems to you that it is good to do,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; another time it seems to you the contrary.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "When you have pondered the matter and have judged by good deliberation such thing as seems best to you,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; then I advise you that you keep it secret.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Reveal your plans to no person, but if it so be that you believe truly <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; through your revealing your condition shall be to you the more advantageous.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For Jesus son of Sirach says, `Neither to thy foe nor to thy friend discover not thy secret nor thy folly,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; for they will give you audience and attention and support in thy presence and scorn thee in thine absence.'<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Another clerk says that `scarcely shalt thou find any person that can keep plans secretly.'<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The book says, `While thou keepest thy plan in thine heart, thou keepest it in thy prison,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and when thou reveal thy plans to any person, he holds thee in his snare.'<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And therefore for you it is better to hide your plans in your heart than pray him<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to whom you have revealed your plans that he will keep it close and still.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For Seneca says: `If it so be that thou can not hide thine own plans,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; how dare thou pray any other person to keep thy advice secretly?'<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But nevertheless, if thou believe truly that the revealing of thy plans to a person will make<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; thy condition stand in the better condition, then shalt thou tell him thy plans in this manner.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; First thou shalt make no outward sign whether thou would prefer peace or war, or this or that,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; nor show him not thy will and thine intent.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For trust well that commonly these advisors are flatterers,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; namely the advisors of great lords,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; for they force themselves always rather to speak pleasant words, inclining to the lord's desire,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; than words that are true or beneficial.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And therefore men say that the rich man has seldom good advice, unless he have it of himself.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And after that thou shalt consider thy friends and thine enemies.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And as concerning thy friends, thou shalt consider which of them are<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; most faithful and most wise and eldest and most proven in giving advice;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and of them shalt thou ask thy advice, as the case requires.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I say that first you shall call to your council your friends that are true.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For Solomon says that `just as the heart of a man delights in taste that is sweet,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; just so the advice of true friends gives sweetness to the soul.'<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He says also, `Nothing can be compared to a true friend,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; for certainly gold nor silver are not worth so much as the good will of a true friend.'<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And also he says that `a true friend is a strong defense; whoever finds it,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; certainly he finds a great treasure.'<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Then shall you also consider whether your true friends are discrete and wise.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For the book says, `Ask always thy advice of those who are wise.'<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And by this same reason shall you call to your council some of your friends that are of suitably advanced age,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; such as have seen and are expert in many things and are proven in giving advice.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For the book says that `in old men is the wisdom, and in long time the prudence. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And Cicero says that `great things are not always accomplished by strength, nor by agility of body, but<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; by good advice, by a person's power to persuade, and by knowledge; the which three things are not enfeebled by age,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; but certainly they gain strength and increase day by day.'<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And then shall you keep this for a general rule: First you shall call to your council<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a few of your friends who are particularly esteemed;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; for Solomon says, `Many friends have thou, but among a thousand chose thyself one to be thy advisor.'<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For although it be so that thou first tell thy advice only to a few,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; thou mayst afterward tell it to more folk if it be needed.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But look always that thy advisors have those three conditions that I have said before --<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; that is to say, that they are true, wise, and of old experience.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And work not always in every need by one advisor alone;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; for sometimes it is necessary to be advised by many.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For Solomon says, `Salvation of things is where there are many advisors.'<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Now, since I have told you of which folk you should be advised, now<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I will teach you which advice you ought to shun.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; First, you shall shun the advice of fools; for Solomon says, `Take no counsel of a fool,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; for he can not advise except in accordance with his own desire and his inclination.'<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The book says that `the characteristic of a fool is this: he easily believes harm of every person,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and easily believes all goodness in himself.'<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thou shalt also shun the advice of all flatterers, such as exert themselves rather to praise your person  <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; by flattery than to tell you the truth of things.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Wherefore Cicero says, `Amongst all the pestilences that are in friendship the greatest is flattery.'<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And therefore is it more needful that thou shun and dread flatterers than any other people.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The book says, `Thou shalt rather dread and flee from the sweet words of flattering praisers<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; than from the sharp words of thy friend who tells thee thy truths.'<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Solomon says that `the words of a flatterer is a snare with which to catch innocents.'<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He says also that `he who speaks to his friend words of sweetness and of pleasance<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; sets a net before his feet to catch him.'<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And therefore says Cicero, `Incline not thine ears to flatterers, and take no advice of the words of flattery.'<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And Cato says, `Ponder thee well, and shun the words of sweetness and of pleasance.'<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And also thou shalt shun the advice of thine old enemies that are reconciled.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The book says that `no person returns safely into the good will of his old enemy.'<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And Aesop says, `Trust not to those with whom thou hast had at some time war or enmity, <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; nor tell them not thy plans.'<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And Seneca tells the reason why: `It may not be,' says he, `that where great<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; fire has long time endured, but that there dwells some vapor of warmness.'<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And therefore says Solomon, `In thine old foe trust never.'<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For surely, though thine enemy be reconciled, and makes thee the appearance of humility,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and bows to thee with his head, trust him never.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For certainly he makes that feigned humility more for his advantage than for any love of thy person,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; because he supposes to have victory over thy person by such feigned behavior,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the which victory he might not have by strife or war.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And Petrus Alphnsus says, `Make no fellowship with thine old enemies, for if thou do them goodness,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; they will pervert it into wickedness.'<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And also thou most shun the advice of those who are thy servants and bear thee great reverence,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; for perhaps they say it more for dread than for love.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And therefore says a philosopher in this manner:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; `There is no person perfectly true to him whom he too sorely dreads.'<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And Cicero says, `There is no might so great of any emperor that long may endure,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; unless he has more love of the people than dread.'<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thou shalt also shun the advice of folk that are drunkards, for they nor can hide no plans.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For Solomon says, `There is no secrecy where drunkenness reigns.'<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You shall also be suspicious of the advice of such folk as<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; advise you one thing privately and counsel you the contrary openly.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For Cassiodorus says that `it is a difficult task to hinder a scheme,  <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; when a person appears to do one thing openly and secretly works the contrary.'<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thou shalt also be suspicious of the advice of wicked folk. For the book says,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; `The advice of wicked folk is always full of fraud.'<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And David says, `Blissful is that man who has not followed the advice of scoundrels.' <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thou shalt also shun the advice of young folk, for their counsel is not ripe.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Now, sir, since I have showed you of which folk you shall take your advice<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and of which folk you shall follow the advice,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; now will I teach you how you shall examine your advice, according to the doctrine of Cicero.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In the examining then of your advisor you shall consider many things .<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; First of all thou shalt consider that in that thing that thou intendest, and upon which thing thou will have advice,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; that real truth be said and preserved; this is to say, tell truly thy tale.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For he that speaks falsely may not well be advised in that case of which he lies.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And after this thou shalt consider the things that agree with that thou intendest<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; for to act as thy advisors advise, if reason accord thereto,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and also if thy might can attain thereto, and if the larger part<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and the better part of thy advisors accord thereto, or not.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Then shalt thou consider what thing shall follow from that advice,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; as hate, peace, war, grace, profit, or damage, and many other things.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And in all these things thou shalt chose the best and abandon all other things .<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Then shalt thou consider of what root is engendered the matter of thy advice<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and what fruit it may conceive and engender.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thou shalt also consider all these causes, from whence they are sprung.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And when you have examined your advice, as I have said, and (decided) which part is the better<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and more beneficial, and have tested it by many wise and old folk,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; then shalt thou consider if thou can perform it and make of it a good end.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For certainly reason will not desire that any man should begin a thing<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; unless he might perform it as he ought to;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; nor no person should take upon him so heavy a charge that he might not bear it.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For the proverb says, `He who too much embraces, keeps little.'<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And Cato says, `Try to do such thing as thou hast power to do,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; lest that the charge oppress thee so sorely that<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; thou art compelled to abandon an undertaking that thou hast begun.'<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And if it so be that thou art in doubt about whether thou can perform a thing or not,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; choose rather to suffer than begin.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And Petrus Alphonsus says, `If thou hast might to do a thing of which thou must repent,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; it is better "nay" than "yea."'<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This is to say, that for thee it is better hold thy tongue still than to speak.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Then may you understand by stronger reasons that if thou hast power to perform a work<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of which thou shalt repent, then is it better that thou suffer than begin.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Well say they who forbid every person to attempt a thing of which he is in doubt<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; whether he can perform it or not.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And after, when you have examined your advice, as I have said before, and know well that<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; you can perform your enterprise, prosecute it then diligently until it be at an end.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Now is it reasonable and time that I show you when and wherefore that<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; you may change your plans without earning dishonor.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Truly, a man may change his purpose and his plans if the cause ceases,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; or when a new case befalls.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For the law says that `things that newly befall require new plans.' <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And Seneca says, `If thy plan is come to the ears of thine enemy, change thy plan.'<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thou mayst also change thy plan if it so be that thou find that by error,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; or by other cause, harm or damage may befall.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Also if thy plan be unjust, or else comes of dishonest cause, change thy plan.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For the laws say that `all promises that are dishonest are of no value';<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and also if it so be that it is impossible, or can not goodly be performed or kept.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "And take this for a general rule, that every plan that is affirmed so strongly that it may not<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; be changed for any condition that may befall, I say that that plan is wicked."<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This Melibeus, when he had heard the doctrine of his wife dame Prudence, answered in this wise:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Dame," said he, "as yet until this time you have well and fittingly taught me as in general how<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I should govern myself in the choice and in the retention of my advisors.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But now would I eagerly desire that you would get down to particulars <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and tell me how you like it, or what it seems to you, concerning our advisors<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; that we have chosen in our present need."<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "My lord," said she, "I beseech you in all humility that you will not willfully reply against my arguments,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; nor upset your heart, though I speak something that may displease you.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For God knows that, in my intent, I speak it for your best,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; for your honor, and for your benefit also.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And truly, I hope that your benignity will take it in patience.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Trust me well," said she, "that your advice in this case should not, to speak properly,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; be called an advising, but a motion or a moving of folly,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; in which advice you have erred in many a different way.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "First of all, you have erred in the assembling of your advisors.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For you should first have called a few folk to your council, and after you might have showed it<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to more folk, if it had been necessary.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But certainly, you have suddenly called to your council a great multitude of people,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; very burdensome and very annoying to hear.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Also you have erred, for whereas you should only have called to your council <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; your true friends old and wise,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; you have called foreign folk, young folk, false flatterers, and enemies reconciled,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and folk who do you reverence without love.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And also you have erred, for you have brought with you to your council anger, greed, and haste,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the which three things are contrary to every council honorable and beneficial;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the which three things you have not annihilated or destroyed them,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; neither in yourself, nor in your advisors, as you ought.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You have erred also, for you have shown to your advisors<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; your desire and your inclination to make war immediately and to do vengeance.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They have espied by your words to what thing you are inclined;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and therefore have they advised you rather to your inclination than to your advantage.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You have erred also, for it seems that to you it suffices<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to have been advised by these counselors only, and with little consultation,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; whereas in so great and so urgent a situation it had been necessary to have more advisors<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and more deliberation to perform your undertaking.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You have erred also, for you have not examined your advice in the foresaid manner,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; nor in suitable manner, as the case requires.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You have erred also, for you have made no division between your advisors -- this is to say,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; between your true friends and your feigned advisors --<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and you have not known the will of your true friends old and wise,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; but you have cast all their words in an hodgepodge, and inclined your heart to the larger part<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and to the greater number, and to that you are yielded.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And since you know well that men shall always find a greater number of fools than of wise men,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and therefore the counsels that are at gatherings and multitudes of folk, where men pay more attention<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to the number than to the wisdom of persons,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; you see well that in such councils fools have the mastery."<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Melibeus answered again, and said, "I grant well that I have erred;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; but whereas thou hast told me before now<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; that he is not to blame who changes his advisors in certain cases and for certain just causes,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I am all ready to change my advisors just as thou will devise.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The proverb says that `to do sin is human,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; but certainly to persevere long in sin is work of the devil.'"<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To this sentence answered immediately dame Prudence, and said,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Examine," said she, "your counsel, and let us see<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the which of them have spoken most reasonably and taught you best advice.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And forasmuch as the examination is necessary, let us begin at the surgeons<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and at the physicians, who first spoke in this matter.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I tell you that the surgeons and physicians have spoken to you in counselling you discretely, as they ought,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and in their speech said very wisely that to their office it pertains to do to every person<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; honor and profit, and no person to harm,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and in accordance with their craft to do great diligence<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; unto the care of those that they have in their governance.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And, sir, just as they have answered wisely and discretely,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; just so I deduce that they are highly and chiefly rewarded for their noble speech,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and also for they should do the more diligent effort in the care of your dear daughter.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For although it be so that they are your friends, therefore shall you not allow <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; that they serve you for naught,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; but you ought the rather to reward them and show them your generosity.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And as touching the theory that the physicians developed in this case -- this is to say,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; that in maladies that one contrary is cured by another contrary --<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I would be eager to know how you understand that text, and what is your interpretation."<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Certainly," said Melibeus, "I understand it in this way:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; that just as they have done me a contrary, right so should I do them another.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For just as they have avenged themselves on me and done me wrong,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; just so shall I avenge myself upon them and do them wrong;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and then have I cured one contrary by another."<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Lo, lo," said dame Prudence, "how easily is every man inclined to his own desire<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and to his own pleasure!<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Certainly," said she, "the words of the physicians should not have been understood in this way.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For certainly, wickedness is not contrary to wickedness, nor vengeance to vengeance,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; nor wrong to wrong, but they are similar.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And therefore one vengeance is not cured by another vengeance, nor one wrong by another wrong,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; but each of them increases and aggravates the other.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But certainly, the words of the physicians should be understood in this way:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; for good and wickedness are two contraries, and peace and war, vengeance<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and forbearance, discord and accord, and many other things ;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; but certainly, wickedness must be cured by goodness, discord by accord, war by peace,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and so forth of other things .<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And to this Saint Paul the Apostle agrees in many places.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He says, `Yield not harm for harm, nor wicked speech for wicked speech,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; but do well to him that does thee harm and bless him that says to thee harm.'<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And in many other places he recommends peace and accord.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But now will I speak to you of the advice which was given to you<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; by the men of law and the wise folk,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; who said all by unanimous agreement, as you have heard before,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; that over all things you shall do your best effort to guard your person and to garrison your house;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and said also that in this case you ought to work very advisedly and with great deliberation.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And, sir, as to the first point, that touches on the keeping of your person,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; you shall understand that he who has war shall evermore meekly and devoutly pray, before all things,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; that Jesus Christ of his mercy will have him in his protection<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and be his best help at his need.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For certainly, in this world there is no person that can be advised nor guarded sufficiently<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; without the protection of our Lord Jesus Christ.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To this opinion agrees the prophet David, who says,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; `If God does not guard the city, in vain watches he who guards it.'<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Now, sir, then shall you commit the guarding of your person<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to your true friends that are proven and known,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and of them shall you ask help to guard your person. For Cato says,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; `If thou hast need of help, ask it of thy friends,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; for there is no physician so good as thy true friend.'<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And after this then shall you keep yourself from all unfamiliar folk, and from liars,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and be always suspicious of their company.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For Petrus Alphonsus says, `take no company by the way of a strange man,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; but if it so be that thou have known him of a longer time.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And if it so be that he fall into thy company by chance, without thine assent,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; inquire then as subtly as thou can of his way of life, and of his life before, and feign thy way;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; say that [thou] wolt thither as thou will not go;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and if he bears a spear, hold thyself on the right side,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and if he bear a sword, hold thyself on the left side.'<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And after this then shall you keep yourself wisely from all such manner people as I have said before,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and them and their advice shun.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And after this then shall you keep yourself in such manner<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; that, for any confidence in your strength, that you nor despise not, nor account not the might<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of your adversary so little that you neglect the protection of your person because of your over-confidence,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; for every wise man dreads his enemy.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And Solomon says, `Happy is he who of all has dread,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; for certainly, he who through the hardiness of his heart and through the hardiness of himself has<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; too great self-confidence, to him shall evil befall.'<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Then shall you evermore watch out for ambushes and all espionage,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For Seneca says that `the wise man who dreads harms, shuns harms,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; nor does he who shuns perils fall into perils.'<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And although it be so that it seems that thou art in a safe place,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; yet shalt thou always do thy best efforts in guarding of thy person;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; this is to say, be not negligent to guard thy person<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; not only from thy greatest enemies but from thy least enemy.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Seneca says, `A man that is well advised, he dreads his least enemy.'<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Ovid says that `the little weasel will slay the great bull and the wild hart.'<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And the book says, `A little thorn may prick a king very sorely,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and a hound will bring to bay the wild boar.'<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But nevertheless, I say not thou should be so cowardly that thou fear where there is no reason for dread.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The book says that `some folk have great desire to deceive, but yet they dread themselves to be deceived.'<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Yet thou should dread to be poisoned and keep thyself from the company of scoffers.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For the book says, `With scorners make no company, but flee their words as venom.'<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Now, as to the second point,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; whereas your wise advisors counseled you to fortify your house with great diligence,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I would be eager to know how you understand those words and what is your decision."<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Melibeus answered and said, "Certainly, I understand it in this way: That I should fortify my house with towers,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; such as have castles and other sorts of edifices, and armor, and artillery,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; by which things I can my person and my house so guard and defend<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; that my enemies shall be in dread to approach my house."<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To this sentence answered immediately Prudence: "Fortifying," said she,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "of high towers and of great edifices pertains sometimes to pride.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And also men make high towers, [and great edifices] with great expenditures and with great travail,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and when that they are accomplished, yet are they not worth a straw,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; unless they are defended by true friends that are old and wise.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And understand well that the greatest and strongest garrison that a rich man may have,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; as well to keep his person as his goods, is<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; that he is beloved by his subjects and by his neighbors.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For thus says Cicero, that `there is a sort of garrison <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; that no man can vanquish nor discomfit, and that is<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; for a lord to be beloved by his citizens and by his people.'<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Now, sir, as to the third point, whereas your old<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and wise advisors said that you ought not suddenly nor hastily proceed in this urgent matter,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; but that you ought to prepare yourself and get ready in this case with great diligence and great deliberation;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; truly, I believe that they spoke very wisely and real truth.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For Cicero says, `In every urgent matter, ere thou begin it, prepare thyself with great diligence.'<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Then say I that in vengeance-taking, in war, in battle, and in fortification,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ere thou begin, I advise that thou prepare thyself for that, and do it with great deliberation.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For Cicero says that `long preparation before the battle makes short victory.'<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And Cassiodorus says, `The protection is stronger when it is long time considered.'<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But now let us speak of the advice that was agreed upon by your neighbors,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; such as do you reverence without love,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; your old enemies reconciled, your flatterers,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; that advised you certain things secretly, and openly counseled you the contrary;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the young folk also, who advised you to avenge yourself and make war immediately.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And certainly, sir, as I have said before, you have greatly erred<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to have called such sort of folk to your council,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; which advisors are enough reproved by the reasons spoken earlier.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But nevertheless, let us now descend to the particular details. You should first proceed according to the doctrine of Cicero.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Certainly, the truth of this matter, or of this advice, we need not diligently inquire,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; for it is well known who they are that have done to you this trespass and villainy,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and how many trespassers, and in what manner<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; they have done to you all this wrong and all this villainy.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And after this, then you should examine the second condition which the same Cicero adds in this matter.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For Cicero hypothesized a thing which he calls `consenting'; this is to say,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; who are they, and which are they and how many that consent to thy advice<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; in thy willfulness to do hasty vengeance.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And let us consider also who are they, and how many are they,   <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and which are they that consented to your adversaries.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And certainly, as to the first point, it is well known which folk are<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; they that consented to your hasty willfulness,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; for truly, all those who advised you to make sudden war are not your friends.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Let us now consider which are they that you consider so greatly your friends as to your person.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For although it be so that you are mighty and rich, certainly you are but alone,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; for certainly you have no child but a daughter,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; nor do you have neither brethren, nor first cousins, nor any other close relatives,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; for which your enemies for dread should stop pleading with you or destroying your person.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You know also that your riches must be dispended in several parts,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and when each person has his part, they will take but little regard to avenging thy death.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But thine enemies are three, and they have many children, brethren, cousins, and other close kin.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And though it so were that thou haddest slain of them two or three, yet dwell there enough<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to avenge their death and to slay thy person.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And though it so be that your kin are more sure and steadfast than the kin of your adversary,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; yet nevertheless your kinship is but a far kinship; they are but little related to you,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and the kin of your enemies are close relatives to them.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And certainly, in that respect, their condition is better than yours.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Then let us consider also the advice of those who advised you to take sudden vengeance,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; whether it accord to reason.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And certainly, you know well `nay.'<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For, by justice and reason, there may no man take vengeance on no person<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; but the judge that has the jurisdiction of it,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; when it is granted to him to take that vengeance hastily or temperately, as the law requires.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And yet moreover of that word that Cicero calls `consenting,'<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; thou should consider if thy might and thy power can consent<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and suffice to thy willfulness and to thy advisors.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And certainly thou can well say that `nay.'<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For truly, strictly speaking, we can do no thing<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; but only such thing as we can do justly.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And certainly in justice must you take no vengeance, as of your own authority.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Then must you see that your power is not consistent, nor accords not, with your willfulness.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Let us now examine the third point, that Cicero calls `consequent.'<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thou shalt understand that the vengeance that thou intendest to take is the consequent;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and thereof follows another vengeance, peril, and war, and other damages without number,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of which we are not aware, at this time.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And as touching the fourth point, what Cicero calls `engendering,'<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; thou shalt consider that this wrong which that is done to thee<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; is engendered by the hate of thine enemies,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and by the vengeance-taking thereupon that would engender another vengeance,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and much sorrow and wasting of riches, as I said.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Now, sir, as to the point that Cicero calls `causes,' which is the last point,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; thou shalt understand that the wrong that thou hast received has certain causes,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; which clerks call Oriens and Efficiens, and Causa longinqua and Causa propinqua;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; this is to say, the far cause and the near cause.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The far cause is almighty God, that is cause of all things .<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The near cause is thy three enemies.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The cause accidental was hate.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The cause material are the five wounds of thy daughter.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The cause formal is the manner of their working who brought ladders and climbed in at thy windows.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The cause final was to slay thy daughter. It did not delay insofar as was in their power.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But to speak of the far cause, as to what end they shall come, or what shall finally<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; happen to them in this case, nor can I judge except by conjecture and by supposing.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For we should suppose that they shall come to a wicked end,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; because the Book of Decrees says, `Seldom, or with great effort, are causes brought to a good end<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; when they are badly begun.'<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Now, sir, if men would ask me why God allowed men to do you this villainy,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; certainly, I can not well answer, with any certainty.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For the apostle says that `the sciences and the judgments of our Lord God almighty are very deep;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; there can no man comprehend nor study them sufficiently.'<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Nonetheless, by certain assumptions and conjectures, I hold and believe<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; that God, who is full of justice and of righteousness, has allowed this to happen by just reasonable cause.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Thy name is Melibee; this is to say, `a man that drinks honey.'<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thou hast drunk so much honey of sweet temporal riches, and pleasures and honors of this world<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; that thou art drunk and hast forgotten Jesus Christ thy creator.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thou hast not done to him such honor and reverence as thee ought,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; nor thou hast not well paid attention to the words of Ovid, who says,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; `Under the honey of the goods of the body is hid the venom that slays the soul.'<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And Solomon says, `If thou hast found honey, eat of it what suffices,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; for if thou eat of it to excess, thou shalt vomit' and be needy and poor.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And perhaps Christ has thee in disdain, and<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; has turned away from thee his face and his ears of mercy,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and also he has allowed that thou hast been punished in the manner that thou hast trespassed.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thou hast done sin again our Lord Christ,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; for certainly, the three enemies of mankind<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -- that is to say, the flesh, the fiend, and the world --<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; thou hast allowed them enter into thine heart willfully by the windows of thy body,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and hast not defended thyself sufficiently against their assaults and their temptations,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; so that they have wounded thy soul in five places;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; this is to say, the deadly sins that are entered into thine heart by thy five senses.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And in the same manner our Lord Christ has willed and allowed <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; that thy three enemies are entered into thine house by the windows<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and have wounded thy daughter in the aforesaid manner."<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Certainly," said Melibee, "I see well that you strengthen yourself much by words to overcome me in such a manner<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; that I shall not avenge me on my enemies,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; showing me the perils and the evils that might fall because of this vengeance.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But if amyone would consider in all vengeances the perils and evils that might follow from vengeance-taking,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a man would never take vengeance, and that would be a harm;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; for by the vengeance-taking are the wicked men distinguished from the good men,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and they that have will to do wickedness restrain their wicked purpose,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; when they see the punishing and chastising of the trespassers."<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And yet say I more, that just as a private person sins in taking vengeance on another man,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; just so sins the judge if he do no vengeance on them that have deserved it.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For Seneca says thus: `That master,' he says, `is good who reproves scoundrels.'<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And as Cassiodorus says, `A man dreads to do outrages when he knows and is aware<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; that it displeases the judges and the rulers.'<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And another says, `The judge that dreads to do justice makes men scoundrels.'<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And Saint Paul the Apostle says in his Epistle, when he writes unto the Romans, that<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; `the judges do not bear the spear without cause,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; but they bear it to punish the scoundrels and evildoers and to defend the good men.'<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If you will then take vengeance on your enemies, you shall turn to or bring your case to the judge<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; that has the jurisdiction upon them,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and he shall punish them as the law asks and requires."<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "A," said Melibee, "this vengeance pleases me not at all.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I consider now and take heed how Fortune has nourished me from my childhood<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and has helped me to pass many a difficult situation.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Now will I test her, believing that, with God's help, she shall help me to avenge my shame."<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Certainly," said Prudence, "if you will work by my advice, you shall not test Fortune in any way,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; nor shall you rely on or bow unto her, according to the word of Seneca,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; for `things that are foolishly done, and that are in hope of Fortune, shall never come to a good end.'<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And, as the same Seneca says, `The more clear and the more shining that Fortune is,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the more brittle and the sooner broken she is.'<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Trust not in her, for she is not steadfast nor stable,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; for when thou believest her to be most sure or certain of her help,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; she will fail thee and deceive thee.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And whereas you say that Fortune has nourished you from your childhood,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I say that to that degree should you have the less trust in her and in her wisdom.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For Seneca says, `Whatever man that is nourished by Fortune, she makes him a great fool.'<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Now then, since you desire and ask vengeance, and the vengeance that is done according to the law<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and before the judge pleases you not,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and the vengeance that is done in hope of Fortune is perilous and uncertain,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; then have you no other remedy but to have your recourse<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; unto the Supreme Judge that avenges all villainies and wrongs.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And he shall avenge you according to what he himself witnesses, where he says,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; `Leave the vengeance to me, and I shall do it.'"<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Melibee answered, "If I do not avenge myself for the villainy that men have done to me,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I summon or announce to them that have done to me that villainy,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and all others, to do me another villainy.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For it is written, `If thou take no vengeance of an old villainy,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; thou summonest thine adversaries to do thee a new villainy.'<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And also for my patience men would do to me so much villainy that<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I might neither bear nor sustain it,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and so should I be put down and considered too humble.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For men say, `In much suffering shall many things happen to thee which thou shalt not be able to endure.'"<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Certainly," said Prudence, "I grant you that over-much patience is not good.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But yet it follows not thereof that every person to whom men do villainy should take vengeance for it,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; for that pertains and belongs entirely only to the judges, for they shall avenge the villainies and injuries.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And therefore those two authorities that you have spoken of above are only understood in the judges,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; for when they allow over-much the wrongs and the villainies to be done without punishing,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; they summon a man not entirely only to do new wrongs, but they command it. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Also a wise man says that `the judge who corrects not the sinner commands and bids him to do sin.'<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And the judges and rulers might in their land so much tolerate the scoundrels and evildoers<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; that they should, because of such tolerance, by the passage of time grow in such power and might<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; that they should put out the judges and the rulers from their places,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and at the last make them lose their lordships.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "But let us now suppose that you have leave to avenge yourself.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I say you are not of might and power right now to avenge yourself,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; for if you will make comparison unto the might of your adversaries, you shall find in many things that<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I have showed you ere this that their condition is better than yours.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And therefore say I that it is good for now that you suffer and be patient.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Furthermore, you know well that according to the common saying, `it is a madness for a man to strive<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; with a stronger or a more mighty man than he is himself,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and to strive with a man of even strength -- that is to say,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; with as strong a man as he is -- it is perilous/85
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and to strive with a weaker man, it is folly.'<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And therefore a man should flee striving as much as he might.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For Solomon says, `It is a great honor to a man to keep himself from quarrels and strife.'<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And if it so befall or happen that a man of greater might and strength<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; than thou art do thee grievance,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; take pains and busy thyself rather to still the same grievance than to avenge thyself.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For Seneca says that `he puts himself in great peril<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; that strives with a greater man than he is himself.'<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And Cato says, `If a man of higher estate or degree, or more mighty than thou,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; do thee annoyance or grievance, endure it,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; for he that once has grieved thee, may another time relieve thee and help.'<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Yet I assume (for the sake of argument) you have both might and permission to avenge yourself,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I say that there are very many things that should restrain you from vengeance-taking<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and make you to incline to suffer, and to have patience<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; in the wrongs that have been done to you.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; First of all, if you will consider the faults that are in your own person,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; for which faults God has allowed you to have this tribulation, as I have said to you before.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For the poet says that `we ought patiently to take the tribulations<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; that come to us, when we think and consider that we have deserved to have them.'<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And Saint Gregory says that `when a man considers well the number of his faults and of his sins,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the pains and the tribulations that he suffers seem the less unto him;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and inasmuch as he thinks his sins more heavy and grievous,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; insomuch seems his pain the lighter and the easier unto him.'<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Also you ought to incline and bow your heart<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to adopt the patience of our Lord Jesus Christ, as says Saint Peter in his Epistles.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; `Jesus Christ,' he says, `has suffered for us and given example to every man to follow and be guided by him,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; for he did never sin, nor never came there a villainous word out of his mouth.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When men cursed him, he cursed them not, and when men beat him, he menaced them not.'<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Also the great patience which the saints that are in Paradise have had in tribulations<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; that they have suffered, without their deserts or guilt,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ought much stir you to patience.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Furthermore you should force yourself to have patience,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; considering that the tribulations of this world but little while endure and soon are passed and gone,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and the joy that a man seeks to have by patience in tribulations is ever-lasting,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; according to what the Apostle says in his epistle.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; `The joy of God,' he says, `is perdurable' -- that is to say, everlasting. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Also think and believe steadfastly that he is not well trained, nor well taught,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; who can not have patience or will not receive patience.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For Solomon says that `the doctrine and the wit of a man is known by patience.'<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And in another place he says that `he that is patient governs himself with great prudence.'<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And the same Solomon says, `The angry and wrathful man makes quarrels,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and the patient man moderates and stills them.'<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He says also, `It is more worthy to be patient than to be very strong;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and he that may have the lordship of his own heart is more to be praised than he that<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; by his force or strength takes great cities.'<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And therefore says Saint James in his Epistle that `patience is a great virtue of perfection.'"<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Certainly," said Melibee, "I grant you, dame Prudence, that patience is a great virtue of perfection;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; but every man may not have the perfection that you seek;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; nor am I of the number of very perfect men,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; for my heart may never be in peace until the time it is avenged.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And although it be so that it was great peril to my enemies<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to do me a villainy in taking vengeance upon me,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; yet took they no heed of the peril, but fulfilled their wicked will and their desire.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And therefore it seems to me men ought not reprove me,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; though I put myself in a little peril in order to avenge myself,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and though I do a great excess; that is to say, that I avenge one outrage by another."<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "A," said dame Prudence, "you say your will and as you please,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; but in no case of the world should a man do outrage nor excess to avenge himself.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For Cassiodorus says that `as evil does he that avenges himself by outrage as he that does the outrage.'<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And therefore you shall avenge yourself after the order of justice; that is to say, by the law<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and not by excess nor by outrage.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And also, if you will avenge yourself of the outrage of your adversaries<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; in other manner than justice commands, you sin.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And therefore says Seneca that `a man shall never avenge wickedness by wickedness." <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And if you say that justice asks a man to fight off violence by violence and fighting by fighting,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; certainly you say truth, when the defense is done immediately without interval or without tarrying or delay,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to defend himself and not to avenge himself.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And it is fitting that a man put so much temperance in his defense<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; that men have no cause nor matter to reprove him that defends himself from excess and outrage,<br> 
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; for otherwise it would be against reason.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; By God, you know well that you make no defense<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; right now to defend yourself, but to avenge yourself;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and so it follows that you have no will to do your deed temperately.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And therefore it seems to me that patience is good. For Solomon says that<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; `he that is not patient shall have great harm.'"<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Certainly," said Melibee, "I grant you that when a man is impatient and angry with that<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; which touches him not and which pertains not unto him, though it harm him, it is no wonder.  <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For the law says that `he is guilty that intrudes himself <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; or meddles with such thing as pertains not unto him.'<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And Solomon says that `he that meddles with the quarrels or strife of another man<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; is like to him that takes an hound by the ears.'<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For just as he that takes a strange hound by the ears is at another time bitten by the hound,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; in just the same way it is reasonable that he have harm who by his impatience meddles himself<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; with the quarrels of another man, whereas it pertains not unto him.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But you know well that this deed -- that is to say,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; my grief and my suffering -- touches me very closely.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And therefore, though I am angry and impatient, it is no marvel.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And, with all due respect to you, I can not see that it might greatly harm me though I took vengeance.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For I am richer and more mighty than my enemies are;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and you well know that by money and by having great possessions<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; are all the things of this world governed.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And Solomon says that `all things obey to money.'"<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When Prudence had heard her husband boast of his riches<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and of his money, belittling the power of his adversaries,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; she spoke and said in this manner:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Certainly, dear sir, I grant you that you are rich and mighty<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and that riches are good to those that have well gotten them and well know how to use them.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For just as the body of a man can not live without the soul,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; no more than it can live without temporal goods.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And by riches a man get can himself great friends.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And therefore says Pamphilles: `If a cowherd's daughter,' says he, `is rich,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; she may choose of a thousand men which she will take to her husband,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; for, of a thousand men, not one will forsake her nor refuse her.'<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And this Pamphilles says also, `If thou be very happy -- that is to say,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; if thou be very rich -- thou shalt find a great number of fellows and friends.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And if thy fortune change that thou wax poor, farewell friendship and fellowship,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; for thou shalt be alone without any company, except if it be the company of poor folk.'<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And yet says this Pamphilles moreover that `they that are enslaved and in bondage by birth<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; shall be made worthy and noble by riches.'<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And just as by riches there come many goods,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; just so by poverty come there many harms and evils,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; for great poverty constrains a man to do many evils.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And therefore Cassiodorus calls poverty the mother of ruin;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; that is to say, the mother of overthrowing or falling down.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And therefore says Petrus Alphonsus, `One of the greatest adversities of this world is<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; when a man free by nature or by birth is constrained by poverty<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to eat the alms of his enemy,'<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and the same says Innocent in one of his books. He says that<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; `sorrowful and unfortunate is the condition of a poor beggar;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; for if he does not beg for his food, he dies for hunger;<br> 
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and if be begs, he dies for shame, and yet necessity constrains him to beg.'<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And says Solomon that `better it is to die than to have such poverty.'<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And as the same Solomon says, `Better it is to die of bitter death<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; than to live in such a way.'<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; By these reasons that I have said unto you and by many other reasons that I could say,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I grant you that riches are good to them that get them well<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and to them that well use those riches.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And therefore will I show you how you should behave, and how you should bear yourself<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; in gathering of riches, and in what manner you shall use them.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "First, you shall get them without great desire, by good deliberation, slowly and not over-hastily.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For a man that is too desiring to get riches devotes himself<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; first to theft, and to all other evils;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and therefore says Solomon, `He that hastens him too busily to wax rich shall be no innocent.'<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He says also that `the riches that hastily come to a man soon<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and easily go and pass from a man,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; but those riches that come little by little always grow and multiply.'<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And, sir, you shall get riches by your wit and by your travail unto your advantage,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and that without doing wrong or harm to any other person.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For the law says that `there makes no man himself rich, if he does harm to another person.'<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This is to say, that nature prohibits and forbids justly that<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; any man make himself rich unto the harm of another person.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And Cicero says that `no sorrow, nor no dread of death, nor no thing<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; that may happen to a man, is so much against<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; nature as for a man to increase his own advantage to the harm of another man.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And though the great men and the mighty men get riches more easily than thou,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; yet thou shalt not be idle nor slow to do thy benefit, for thou shalt in all ways flee idleness.'<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For Solomon says that `idleness teaches a man to do many evils.'<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And the same Solomon says that `he that works and busies himself to till his land shall eat bread,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; but he that is idle and devotes himself to no business<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; nor occupation shall fall into poverty and die for hunger.'<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And he that is idle and slow can never find suitable time to earn his profit.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For there is a versifier says that `the idle man excuses himself in winter because<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of the great cold, and in summer by reason of the great heat.'<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For these causes says Cato, `Wake and incline you not over-much to sleep,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; for over-much rest nourishes and causes many vices.'<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And therefore says Saint Jerome, `Do some good deeds that the devil,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; which is our enemy, not find you unoccupied.'<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For the devil takes not easily unto his power such as he finds occupied in good works.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Then thus in getting riches you must flee idleness.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And afterward, you must use the riches which you have gotten by your wit and by your labor<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; in such a manner that men consider you not too niggardly, nor too frugal, nor too foolishly generous<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -- that is to say, over-generous a spender.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For just as men blame an avaricious man because of his niggardliness and miserliness,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; in the same way is he to blame that spends over-generously.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And therefore says Cato: `Use,' he says, `thy riches that thou hast gotten<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; in such a manner that men have no reason nor cause to call thee neither wretch nor miser,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; for it is a great shame to a man to have a poor heart and a rich purse.'<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He says also, `The goods that thou hast gotten, use them by measure;'<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; that is to say, spend them moderately,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; for they who foolishly waste and squander the goods that they have,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; when they have no more property of their own, they devote themselves to taking the goods of another man.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I say then that you must flee avarice,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; using your riches in such a manner that men say not that your riches are buried<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; but that you have them in your power and in your control.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For a wise man reproves the avaricious man, and says thus in two verses:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; `For what reason and why buries a man his goods by his great avarice,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and he knows well that by necessity he must die?<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For death is the end of every man in this present life.'<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And for what cause or reason he joins himself or he knits himself so fast unto his goods<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; that all his wits can not separate him or depart him from his goods,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and knows well, or ought know, that when he is dead<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; he shall nothing bear with him out of this world?<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And therefore says Saint Austin that `the avaricious man is likened unto hell,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; that the more it swallows the more desire it has to swallow and devour.'<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And as well as you would shun to be called an avaricious man or miser,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; as well should you keep yourself and govern yourself in such a way that men do not call you foolishly generous.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Therefore says Cicero: `The goods,' he says, `of thine house should not be hidden nor kept so close,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; but that they might not be opened by pity and graciousness'<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (that is to say, to give part to them that have great need),<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; `Nor thy goods must not be so open to be every man's goods.'<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Afterward, in getting of your riches and in using them you must always have three things in your heart<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (that is to say, our Lord God, conscience, and good name).<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; First, you shall have God in your heart,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and for no riches you shall do any thing which may in any manner displease God,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; that is your creator and maker.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For after the word of Solomon, `It is better to have a little good with the love of God<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; than to have much good and treasure and lose the love of his Lord God.'<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And the prophet says that `better it is to be a good man and have little good and treasure<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; than to be held a scoundrel and have great riches.'<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And yet say I furthermore, that you should always do your business to get yourself riches,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; providing that you get them with good conscience.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And the Apostle says that `there is nothing in this world of which<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; we should have so great joy as when our conscience bears us good witness.'<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And the wise man says, `The substance of a man is very good,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; when sin is not in man's conscience.'<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Afterward, in getting of your riches and in using of them,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; you must have great effort and greet diligence that your good name be always kept and conserved.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For Solomon says that `better it is and more it avails a man to have a good name<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; than to have great riches.'<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And therefore he says in another place, `Do great diligence,' says Solomon,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; `in keeping of thy friend and of thy good name;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; for it shall longer abide with thee than any treasure, be it never so precious.'<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And certainly he should not be called a gentle man who after God and good conscience, all other things left aside,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; does his best efforts and effort to keep his good name.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And Cassiodorus says that `it is sign of a gentle heart<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; when a man loves and desires to have a good name.'<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And therefore says Saint Austin that `there are two things that are necessary and needful,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and that is good conscience and good reputation;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; that is to say, good conscience to thine own person inward and good reputation for thy neighbor outward.'<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And he that trusts himself so much in his good conscience<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; that he displeases, and sets at naught his good name or reputation,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and cares not though he keep not his good name, is but a cruel churl.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Sir, now have I showed you how you shall do in getting riches, and how you shall use them,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and I see well that for the trust that you have in your riches<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; you will provoke war and battle.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I advise you that you begin no war in trust of your riches,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; for they do not suffice to maintain wars.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And therefore says a philosopher, `That man who desires and will continually have war, shall never have enough,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; for the richer that he is, the greater expenditures must he make, if he will have worship and victory.'<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And Solomon says that `the greater riches that a man has, the more spenders he has.'<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And, dear sir, although it be so that for your riches you can have much folk,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; yet it is not suitable, nor is it any good, to begin war whereas you can<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; in another manner have peace unto your honor and advantage.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For the victory of battles that are in this world lies not in great number or multitude<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of the people, nor in the strength of man,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; but it lies in the will and in the hand of our Lord God Almighty.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And therefore Judas Machabeus, who was God's knight,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; when he had to fight against his adversary who has a greater number<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and a greater multitude of folk and stronger than was this people of Machabee,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; yet he comforted his little company, and said exactly in this way:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; `As easily,' said he, `may our Lord God Almighty give victory to a few folk as to many folk,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; for the victory of a battle comes not by the great number of people,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; but it comes from our Lord God of heaven.'<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And, dear sir, since there is no man certain if he be worthy that<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; God give him victory . . . or not, according to what Solomon says,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; therefore every man should greatly dread to begin wars.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And because in battles many perils befall,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and happens another time that as soon is the great man slain as the little man;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and as it is written in the second Book of Kings,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; `The deeds of battles are subject to chance and in no way certain,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; for as easily is one hurt with one spear as another';<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and for there is great peril in war, therefore should a man flee and shun war,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; insomuch as a man may goodly (do so).<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For Solomon says, `He who loves peril shall fall in peril.'"<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; After Dame Prudence had spoken in this manner, Melibee answered and said,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "I see well, dame Prudence, that by your fair words and by your reasons<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; that you have showed me, that the war not at all pleases you;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; but I have not yet heard your advice, how I shall do in this urgent matter."<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Certainly," said she, "I advise you that you agree with your adversaries and that you have peace with them.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For Saint James says in his Epistles that `by agreeent and peace the small riches wax great,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and by debate and discord the great riches fall down.'<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And you know well that one of the greatest and most excellent things<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; that is in this world is unity and peace.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And therefore said our Lord Jesus Christ to his apostles in this manner:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; `Well happy and blessed are they that love and bring about peace, for they are called children of God.'"<br> 
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"A," said Melibee, "now see I well that you love not my honor nor my worthiness.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You know well that my adversaries have begun this debate and strife by their outrage,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and you see well that they neither require nor pray me for peace,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; nor they ask not to be reconciled.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Will you then that I go and humble myself, and be subject to them, and beg them for mercy?<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Indeed, that would not be to my honor.<br> 
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For just as men say that `over-great familiarity engenders contempt,' <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; so fares it by too great humility or meekness."<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Then began dame Prudence to make the outward appearance of wrath and said:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Certainly, sir, with all due respect to you, I love your honor and your well-being<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; as I do my own, and ever have done;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; nor you, nor any other, can say never the contrary.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And yet if I had said that you should have brought about the peace<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and the reconciliation, I had not much mistaken me nor said amiss.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For the wise man says, `The dissension begins by another man,<br> 
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And the prophet says, `Flee shrewdness and do goodness;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; seek peace and follow it, as much as in thee is.'<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Yet say I not that you should rather sue to your adversaries for peace than they should (offer peace) to you.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For I know well that you are so hard-hearted that you will do nothing for me.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And Solomon says, `He that has over-hard a heart, at the last he shall have bad luck and suffer misfortune.'"<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When Melibee had heard dame Prudence make the appearance of wrath, he said in this manner:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Dame, I pray you that you be not displeased by things that I say,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; for you know well that I am angry and wrathful, and that is no wonder;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and they that are wrathful know not well what they do nor what they say.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Therefore the prophet says that `troubled eyes have no clear sight.'<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But say and advise me as you like, for I am ready to do just as you will desire;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and if you reprove me for my folly,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I am the more obligated to love you and to praise you.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For Solomon says that `he that reproves him who does folly,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; he shall find greater grace than he who deceives him by sweet words.'"<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Then said dame Prudence, "I make no outward appearance of wrath nor anger, but for your great advantage.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For Solomon says, `He is more worthy that reproves or chides a fool for his folly,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; showing him the outward appearance of wrath, <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; than he who supports him and praises him in his misdoing and laughs at his folly.'<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And this same Solomon says afterward that<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; `by the sorrowful visage of a man'<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (that is to say by the sorry and heavy countenance of a man)<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; `the fool corrects and amends himself.'"<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Then said Melibee, "I shall not know how to answer to<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; so many fair reasons as you set forth and show to me.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Say shortly your will and your advice, and I am all ready to fulfill and perform it."<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Then dame Prudence uncovered all her will to him and said,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "I advise you," said she, "above all things , that you make peace between God and you,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and are reconciled unto him and to his grace.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For, as I have said to you here before this, God has allowed you<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to have this tribulation and suffering for your sins.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And if you do as I tell you, God will send your adversaries unto you<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and make them fall at your feet, ready to do your will and your commandments.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For Solomon says, `When the condition of man is pleasant and pleasing to God,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; he changes the hearts of the man's adversaries and constrains them to beseech him for peace and for grace.'<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And I pray you let me speak with your adversaries in a private place,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; for they must not know that it is of your will or of your assent.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And then, when I know their will and their intent, I can advise you the more surely."<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Dame," said Melibee, "do your will and your pleasure;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; for I put me wholly in your disposition and ordinance."<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Then dame Prudence, when she saw the good will of her husband, considered and pondered in herself,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; thinking how she might bring this urgent matter unto a good conclusion and to a good end.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And when she saw her time, she sent for these adversaries to come unto her into a private place<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and showed wisely unto them the great goods that come of peace<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and the great harms and perils that are in war,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and said to them in a goodly manner how that they ought to have great repentance<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; for the injury and wrong that they had done to Melibee her lord,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and unto her, and to her daughter.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And when they heard the goodly words of dame Prudence,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; they were so taken and ravished and had such great joy of her that it was a wonder to tell.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "A, lady," said they, "you have showed unto us the blessing of sweetness,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; according to the saying of David the prophet,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; for the reconciliation which we are not worthy to have in any manner,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; but we ought to request it with great contrition and humility,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; that you of your great goodness have presented unto us.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Now see we well that the knowledge and the cunning of Solomon is very true.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For he says that `sweet words multiply and increase friends<br> 
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and make scoundrels to be gentle and meek.'<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Certainly," said they, "we put our actions and all our matters and cause all wholly in your good will<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and are ready to obey to the speech and commandment of my lord <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And therefore, dear and benign lady, we pray you and beseech you as meekly as we know how and are able<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; that it be pleasing unto your great goodness to fulfill in deed your goodly words,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; for we consider and acknowledge that we have offended and grieved my lord Melibee out of measure,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; so far that we are not of power to make his amends.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And therefore we pledge and bind us and our friends to do all his will and his commandments.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But perhaps he has such heaviness and such wrath toward us because of our offense<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; that he will impose on us such a punishment as we can not bear nor sustain.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And therefore, noble lady, we beseech to your womanly pity<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to take such thought in this urgent matter that<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; we nor our friends are not dispossessed nor destroyed through our folly."<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Certainly," said Prudence, "it is a hard thing and very perilous<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; that a man put himself entirely in the power of decision and judgment,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and in the might and power of his enemies.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For Solomon says, `Believe me, and give credence to what I shall say: I say,' said he,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; `you people, folk and governors of holy church,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to thy son, to thy wife, to thy friend, nor to thy brother<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; give thou never power (over) nor mastery of thy body while thou livest.'<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Now since he forbids that a man should give to his brother<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; nor to his friend the control of his body,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; by a stronger reason he prohibits and forbids a man to give himself to his enemy.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And nevertheless I advise you that you mistrust not my lord,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; for I know well and know truly that he is gentle and humble, generous, courteous,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and in no way desirous nor covetous of goods nor riches.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For there is nothing in this world that he desires, save only worship and honor.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Furthermore I know well and am very sure that he shall do nothing in this urgent matter without my advice,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and I shall so work in this cause that by the grace of our Lord God<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; you shall be reconciled unto us."<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Then said they with one voice, "Worshipful lady, we put us<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and our goods all fully in your will and power,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and are ready to come, what day that it pleases unto your noblesse to limit us or assign us,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to make our pledge and bond as strong as it pleases unto your goodness,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; that we may fulfill the will of you and of my lord Melibee."<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When dame Prudence had heard the answers of these men, she bad them go again secretly;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and she returned to her lord Melibee, and told him how she found his adversaries very repentant,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; acknowledging very lowly their sins and trespass, and how they were ready to suffer any punishment,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; requesting and praying him of mercy and pity.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Then said Melibee: "He is well worthy to have pardon<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and forgiveness of his sin, who does not excuse his sin<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; but acknowledges it and repents himself, asking indulgence.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For Seneca says, `There is the remission and forgiveness, where the confession is,'<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; for confession is neighbor to innocence.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And he says in another place that `he who has shame of his sin and acknowledges<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; [it is worthy of having remission].' And therefore I assent and resolve myself to have peace;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; but it is good that we do it not without the assent and will of our friends."<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Then was Prudence very glad and joyful and said:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Certainly, sir," said she, "you have well and goodly answered,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; for just as by the advice, assent, and help of your friends<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; you have been stirred to avenge yourself and make war,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; just so without their advice shall you not reconcile yourself nor have peace with your adversaries.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For the law says, `There is no thing so good in the natural course of events kind as for a thing<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to be unbound by him who bound it.'"<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And then dame Prudence without delay or tarrying sent immediately her messages for her kin<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and for her old friends which that were true and wise,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and told them in detail in the presence of Melibee all this matter<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; as it is above expressed and declared,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and prayed them that they would give their counsel and advice what best were to do in this urgent matter.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And when Melibee's friends had taken her counsel and deliberation on the foresaid matter,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and had examined it by great effort and greet diligence,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; they gave unqualified advice to have peace and rest,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and that Melibee should with good heart receive his adversaries to forgiveness and mercy.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And when dame Prudence had heard the assent of her lord Melibee, and the advice of his friends<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; agree with her will and her intention,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; she was wonderfully glad in her heart and said:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "There is an old proverb," said she, "which says that `the goodness that thou can do this day, do it,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and abide not nor delay it not till tomorrow.'<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And therefore I advise that you send your messengers, such as are discrete and wise,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; unto your adversaries, telling them on your behalf<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; that if they will negotiate about peace and about harmony,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; that they prepare themselves without delay or tarrying to come unto us."<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Which thing was carried out in deed.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And when these trespassers and folk repenting of their follies<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -- that is to say, the adversaries of Melibee --<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; had heard what these messengers said unto them,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; they were just glad and joyful, and answered very meekly and benignly,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; yielding thanks and gratitude to their lord Melibee and to all his company,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and prepared themselves without delay to go with the messengers <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and obey to the command of their lord Melibee.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And right away they took their way to the court of Melibee,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and took with them some of their true friends<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to stand surety for them and to be their guarantors.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And when they were come to the presence of Melibee, he said to them these words:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "It stands thus," said Melibee, "and true it is, that you,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; causeless and without logical explanation and reason,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; have done great injuries and wrongs to me and to my wife Prudence and to my daughter also.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For you have entered into my house by violence,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and have done such outrage that all men know well that you have deserved the death.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And therefore will I know and learn of you<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; whether you will put the punishment and the chastising and the vengeance of this outrage in the power<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of me and of my wife Prudence, or will you not?"<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Then the wisest of them three answered for them all and said,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Sir," said he, "we know well that we are unworthy to come unto the court<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of so great a lord and so worthy as you are.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For we have so greatly transgressed, and have offended<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and done wrong in such a way against your high lordship<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; that truly we have deserved the death.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But yet, for the great goodness and gentleness that all the world witnesses of your person,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; we submit ourselves to the excellence and benignity of your gracious lordship,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and are ready to obey all your commandments,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; beseeching you that of your merciful pity<br> 
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; you will consider our great repentance and low submission<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and grant us forgiveness of our outrageous trespass and offense.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For well we know that your liberal grace and mercy<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; stretch themselves farther into goodness than do our outrageous guilts and trespass into wickedness,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; although it be so that cursedly and damnably we have sinned against your high lordship."<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Then Melibee took them up from the ground very benignly,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and received their pledges and their bonds by their oaths upon their pledges and guarantors,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and assigned them a certain day to return unto his court<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to accept and receive the sentence and judgment that Melibee would command<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to be done on them by the causes aforesaid.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Which things arranged, every man returned to his house.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And when dame Prudence saw her time, she questioned and asked her lord Melibee<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; what vengeance he thought to take upon his adversaries.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To which Melibee answered and said, "Certainly," said he, "I think and purpose me fully<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to dispossess them of all that ever they have and to put them in exile for ever."<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Certainly," said dame Prudence, "this would be a cruel sentence and much again reason.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For you are rich enough and have no need of other men's wealth,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and you might easily in this way get yourself a covetous name,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; which is a vicious thing, and ought to be shunned by every good man.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For according to the saying of the word of the Apostle, `Greed is root of all harms.'<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And therefore it were better for you to lose so much wealth of your own<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; than to take their wealth in this manner,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; for better it is to lose wealth with honor than it is to acquire wealth with villainy and shame.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And every man ought to do his best efforts and his main concern to get himself a good name.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And yet shall he not only busy himself in keeping of his good name,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; but he shall also strive always to do something by which he may renew his good name.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For it is written that `the old good reputation or good name of a man is soon gone<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and passed, when it is not renewed nor restored.'<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And as touching that you say you will exile your adversaries,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; that thinks me much against reason and out of measure,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; considered the power that they have given you upon themselves.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And it is written that `he is worthy to lose his privilege that misuses<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the might and the power that is given him.'<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And I assume (for the sake of argument) you might impose on them that punishment by justice and by law,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; which I believe you can not do;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I say perhaps you could not put it to execution,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and then it would be likely to return to the war as it was before.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And therefore, if you want men to do you obedience, you must judge more courteously;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; this is to say, you must give more easy sentences and judgments.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For it is written that `he who most courteously commands, to him men most obey.'<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And therefore I pray you that in this necessity and in this urgent matter  <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; you endeavor to overcome your heart.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For Seneca says that `he that overcomes his heart overcomes twice.'<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And Cicero says, `There is no thing so commendable in a great lord<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; as when he is gentle and meek, and calms himself easily.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And I pray you that you will forbear now to do vengeance,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; in such a manner that your good name may be kept and conserved,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and that men may have cause and matter to praise you for pity and for mercy,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and that you have no cause to repent yourself of thing that you do.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For Seneca says, `He overcomes in an evil manner who repents himself of his victory.'<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Wherefore I pray you, let mercy be in your heart,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to the effect and intent that God Almighty have mercy on you in his last judgment.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For Saint James says in his Epistle: `Judgment without mercy shall be done<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to him that has no mercy for another person.'"<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </b>When Melibee had heard the great logical arguments and reasons of<br> 
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; dame Prudence, and her wise counsels and teachings,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; his heart began to incline to the will of his wife, considering her true intent,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and conformed him immediately and assented fully to work according to her advice,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and thanked God, of whom proceeds all virtue and all goodness,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; that sent him a wife of so great discretion.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And when the day came that his adversaries should appear in his presence,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; he spoke unto them very goodly, and said in this manner:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Although it be so that of your pride and high presumption<br> 
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  and folly, and of your negligence and ignorance,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; you have misbehaved yourself and trespassed unto me,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; yet forasmuch as I see and behold your great humility<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and that you are sorry and repentant of your guilts,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; it constrains me to do you grace and mercy.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Wherefore I receive you to my grace<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and forgive you completely all the offenses, injuries, and <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; wrongs that you have done against me and mine,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to this effect and to this end, that God of his endless mercy<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; will at the time of our dying forgive us our guilts<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; that we have trespassed to him in this wretched world.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For doubtless, if we are sorry and repentant of the sins and guilts which we have trespassed<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; in the sight of our Lord God,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; he is so free and so merciful<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; that he will forgive us our guilts<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and bring us to the bliss that never has end." Amen.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; By the time that the Manciple had his tale all ended,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The sun from the meridian was descended<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So low that he was not, to my sight,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; More than nine and twenty degrees in altitude.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Four of the clock it was then, as I suppose,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For eleven feet, or little more or less,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; My shadow was there at that same time,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of such feet as if my height were divided<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Into six feet equal in size.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Therewith the moon's exaltation --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I mean Libra -- steadily ascended<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As we were entering at edge of a village;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For which our Host, since he was accustomed to guide,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; On this occasion, our jolly company,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Said in this manner: "Gentlemen, every one,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Now we lack no tales more than one.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Fulfilled is my plan and my decree;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I believe that we have heard from each social class;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Almost fulfilled is all my governance.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I pray to God, give right good luck to him,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who tells this tale to us pleasingly.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Sire priest," said he, "art thou a vicar?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or art thou a parson? Tell the truth, by thy faith!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Be whatever thou may be, break thou not our rules;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For every man, save thou, has told his tale.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Unbuckle and show us what is in thy bag;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For truly, it seems to me from your appearance<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thou shouldest well conclude a long discourse.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Tell us a fictional tale right now, for cock's bones!"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This Parson answered, immediately,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Thou gettest no fiction told by me,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For Paul, who writes unto Timothy,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Reproves them that abandon truthfulness<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And tell fictional tales and such wretched things.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Why should I sow chaff out of my fist,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When I can sow wheat, if I so wish?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For which I say, if you want to hear<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Morality and virtuous subject matter,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And providing that you will give me your attention,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I will very gladly, to Christ's reverence,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Provide you with permissible pleasure, insofar as I can.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But trust well, I am a Southern man;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I can not recite `rum, ram, ruf,' letter by letter,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And, God knows, rime I consider but little better;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And therefore, if you wish -- I will not deceive you --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I will yow tell a merry tale in prose<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To conclude all this festivity and make an end.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And Jesus, for his grace, send me wit<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To show you the way, in this journey,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of that same perfect glorious pilgrimage<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That is called Jerusalem celestial.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And if you agree, I shall right now<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Begin my tale, for which I pray you<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To tell your decision; I can say nothing better.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "But nonetheless, this meditation<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I put it ever subject to correction<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; By clerks, for I am not learned in texts;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I take from them only the meaning, trust well.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Therefore I make this declaration<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That I will be subject to correction."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Upon this word we have quickly assented,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For, as it seemed, it was the best to do --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To end in some virtuous subject matter,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And to give him time and attention,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And told our Host he should to him say<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That we all pray him to tell his tale.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Our Host had the words for us all;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Sire priest," said he, "now may good fortune come to you!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Tell," said he, "your meditation.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But make haste; the sun is about to go down;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Be fruitful, and that in little time,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And to do well God send you his grace!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Say what you wish, and we will gladly hear."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And with that word he said in this manner.<BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There was, as Titus Livius tells,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A knight who was called Virginius,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Filled with honor and with worthiness,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And having powerful friends, and great wealth.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This knight had a daughter by his wife;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; No more children had he in all his life.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Fair was this maid in excellent beauty<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Above every person that one may see;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For Nature has with her greatest diligence<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Formed her in such great excellence,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As though she would say, "Lo! I, Nature,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thus can I form and paint a creature,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When I wish; who can counterfeit my work?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Not Pygmalion, though he always forge and beat,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or carve, or paint; for I dare well say<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Apelles  or Zeuxis, should work in vain<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Either to carve, or paint, or forge, or beat,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If they presumed to imitate me.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For He who is the principal creator<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Has appointed me his Chief Deputy,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To form and paint earthly creatures<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Right as I wish, and in my control is each thing <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Under the moon, which may grow less or grow larger,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And nothing at all will I ask for my work;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; My lord and I are fully in agreement.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I made her to the worship of my lord;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So do I all my other creatures,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Whatever complexion they have or whatever shapes."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It seems to me that Nature would say thus.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This maid was twelve years of age and two,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In whom Nature had such delight.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For just as she can paint a lily white,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And a rose red, just so with such pigments<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Has she painted this noble creature,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Before she was born, upon her noble limbs,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Where such colors should rightly be; <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And Phebus has dyed her great tresses<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Resembling the rays of his burnished sunbeams.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And if her beauty was excellent,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A thousand times more virtuous was she.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In her there lacked no characteristic<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That is to be praised by (one with) sound moral judgement.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As well in spirit as in body chaste was she,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For which she flourished in virginity<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With all humility and abstinence,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With all temperance and patience,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With moderation also in demeanor and dress.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She was always discreet in conversation;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Though she was wise as Pallas, I dare say,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Her manner of speaking was also very womanly and plain,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; No pretentious terms had she<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To seem wise, but in accordance with her rank in life<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She spoke, and all her words, long speeches and brief,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In accord with virtue and nobility.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Modest she was in maidenly modesty,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Constant in heart, and ever diligent<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To keep herself away from idle sluggishness.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Bacchus had no mastery of her mouth at all;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For wine and youth does increase (the power of) Venus,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As if men would cast oil or grease into a fire.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And of her own moral strength, of her own free choice,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She has very often pretended to be ill,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Because she wanted to flee the company<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Where there was likely to be talk of folly,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As is at feasts, revels, and at dances,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That provide opportunities for flirtations.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Such things make children to be<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Too soon ripe and bold, as anyone can see,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Which is very perilous and has been since long ago,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For all too soon may she learn the lore<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of boldness, when she is grown to be a wife.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And you mistresses, in your old age,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who have lords' daughters in governance,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Do not take of my words any displeasure.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Think that you are set in charge <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of lords' daughters only for two things:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Either because you have kept your chastity,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or else you have fallen into frailty,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And know very well the tricks of the trade,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And have fully renounced such misconduct<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For evermore; therefore, for Christ's sake,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Look that you do not desisit from teaching them virtue.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A thief of venison, who has abandoned<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His greedy appetite and all his old craft,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Can guard a forest better than any other man.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Now guard well, for if you want (to do it), you can.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Take good care that you assent unto no vice,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Lest you be damned for your wicked intent;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For whoever does so, is a traitor, certainly.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And pay attention to what I shall say:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of all betrayals the supreme wickedness<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Is when a person betrays innocence.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You fathers and you mothers also as well,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If you have children, be it one or more,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Yours is the responsibility for all their supervision,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; While they are under your governance.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Beware, lest by example of your (manner of) living,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or by your negligence in chastising,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That they should perish; for I dare well say<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If they do, you shall dearly pay for it.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Under a soft and negligent shepherd <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The wolf has many a sheep and lamb torn to pieces.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Let one ensample sufficefor the present,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For I must turn again to my subject.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This maiden, of whom I will narrate this tale,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So guarded herself she needed no governess<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For in her manner of life maidens might read,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As in a book, every good word or deed<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That is proper to a virtuous maiden,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She was so prudent and so filled with good.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For which sprang out all around the fame,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Both of her beauty and her goodness widespread,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So that throughout that land they praised her everyone<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who loved virtue, save Envy alone,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who is sorry of other men's prosperity<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And is glad of his sorrow and his misery.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (The Doctor [St. Augustine] makes this description.)<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This maid upon a day went in the town<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Toward a temple, with her mother dear,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As is the manner of young maidens.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Now was there then a justice in that town,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who was governor of that region.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And it so happened that this judge cast his eyes <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Upon this maid, considering her very intently,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As she passed by where this judge stood.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Immediately his heart changed and his mood,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So was he caught by the beauty of this maid,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And to himself very secretly he said,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "This maid shall be mine, despite what any man (may do)!"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Immediately. the fiend ran into his heart,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And taught him suddenly that he by trickery <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Could win the maiden to his purpose.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For certainly, not by any force nor by any bribery,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He thought, would he be able to succeed;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For she had powerful friends, and also she<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Was confirmed in such supreme goodness<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That he knew well he could never win her <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And make her sin with her body.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For which, after great deliberation,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He sent for a churl, who was in the town,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Whom he knew for trickery and for boldness.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This judge unto this churl his tale has told<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Secretly, and made him swear <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He should tell it to no creature,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And if he did, he should lose his head.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When this cursed plot was agreed upon<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Glad was this judge, and made much of him (the churl),<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And gave him precious and expensive gifts.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When all their conspiracy was planned<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In great detail, how his lechery<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Should be accomplished very subtly,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As you shall later hear it clearly,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Home goes the churl, who is called Claudius.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This false judge, who is called Apius,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (Such was his name, for this is no fable,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But known for a noteworthy historical fact;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The substance of it is true, beyond doubt),<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This false judge goes now fast about<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Hastening his delight all that he can.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And so it happened soon after, on a certain day,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This false judge, as the story tells us,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As he was accustomed, sat in his court,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And gave his judgements upon various cases.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This false churl came forth at a very rapid pace,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And said, "Lord, if it be your will,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Do me justice concerning this piteous formal complaint,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In which I complain about Virginius;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And if he will say it is not thus,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I will prove it, and find good evidence,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That what my formal complaint will express is truth."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The judge answered, "Of this, in his absence,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I can not give definitive judgment.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Let him be called, and I will gladly hear (the case);<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thou shalt have all justice, and no wrong here."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Virginius came to learn the judge's will,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And right away this cursed complaint was read;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The substance of it was as you shall hear:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "To you, my lord, Sir Apius so dear,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Your poor servant Claudius shows<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; How a knight, called Virginius,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Against the law, against all equity,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Expressly against my will, holds <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; My servant, who is my slave by right,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who was stolen from my house upon one night,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; While she was very young; this will I prove<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; By evidence, lord, providing that you be not displeased.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She is not his daughter, whatever he may say.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Therefore to you, my lord judge, I pray,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Yield me my slave, if it be your will."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Lo, this was all the substance of his complaint.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Virginius began to look upon the churl,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Hastily, before he finished telling his tale,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And would have proven it as a knight should (by battle),<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And also by the evidence of many a person,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That all that his adversary said was false,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This cursed judge would not at all delay,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Nor hear one word more from Virginius,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But gave his judgment, and said thus:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "I decide that this churl should have his slave right now;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thou shalt no longer keep her in thine house.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Go bring her forth, and put her in our guardianship.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The churl shall have his slave, this I decree."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And when this worthy knight Virginius<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Because of the verdict of this justice Apius<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; By force had to give his dear daughter<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Unto the judge, to live in lechery,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He goes home, and sat himself in his hall,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And immediately had his dear daughter called,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And with a face as dead as cold ashes <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Upon her humble face he did behold,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With a father's pity stabbing through his heart,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Although he would not deviate from his purpose.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Daughter," said he, "Virginia, by thy name,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There are two ways, either death or shame,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That thou most suffer; alas, that I was born!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For never thou deservedest for whatever reason<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To die by a sword or by a knife.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; O dear daughter, ender of my life,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Whom I have nurured with such pleasure<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That thou were never out of my thoughts!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; O daughter, who art my greatest woe,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And in my life my greatest joy also,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; O gem of chastity, in patience<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Take thou thy death, for this is my decision.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For love, and not for hate, thou must be dead;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; My piteous hand must smite off thy head.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Alas, that ever Apius saw thee!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For that reason he has falsely judged thee to-day" --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And told her the whole business, as you before<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Have heard; there is no need to tell it again.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "O mercy, dear father!" said this maid,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And with that word she both her arms laid<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; About his neck, as she was accustomed to do.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The tears burst out of her two eyes,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And said, "Good father, must I dye?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Is there no grace, is there no remedy?"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "No, certainly, dear daughter mine," said he.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Then give me time, father mine," said she,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "To lament my death for a little while;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For, truly, Jeptha gave his daughter grace<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To lament, before he slew her, alas!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And, God knows it,  her trespass was nothing,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Except that she ran first to see her father,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To welcome him with great solemnity."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And with that word immediately she fell in a swoon,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And afterwards, when her swooning is gone,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She rises up, and to her father said,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Blessed be God that I shall die a maid!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Give me my death, before I have dishonor;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Do with your child your will, in God's name!"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And with that word she prayed him repeatedly<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That with his sword he would smite gently;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And with that word down she fell in a swoon.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Her father, with very sorrowful heart and will,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Struck off her head, and by the hair siezed it,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And he did present it to the judge,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As he sat yet rendering judgements in court.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And when the judge saw it, as says the story,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He ordered [his men] to take him and hang him at once;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But right away a thousand people burst in,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To save the knight, for compassion and for pity,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For the false wickedness was known.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The people immediately suspected in this matter,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Because of the manner of the churl's claim,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That it was by the conspiring of Apius;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They knew well that he was lecherous.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For which unto this Apius they go<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And cast him in a prison straightway,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Where he slew himself; and Claudius,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who was servant unto this Apius,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Was condemned to hang upon a tree,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Except that Virginius, of his pity,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So prayed for him (Claudius) that he was exiled;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And also, certainly, he had been tricked (by Apius).<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The remnant were hanged, high ranking and low,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who were accessories to this crime.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Here may men see how sin has its reward.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Beware, for no man knows whom God will smite<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In any rank, nor in what sort of way;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The worm of conscience may tremble for fear<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Because of a wicked life, though it so secret be<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That no man knows about it but God and he.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For be he ignorant man, or else learned,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He knows not how soon he shall be terrified.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Therefore I advise you to take this counsel:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Abandon sin, before sin abandons you.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When Arcite was come to Thebes,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Very often each day he grew faint and said "Alas!"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For he shall never more see his lady.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And shortly to conclude (telling) all his woe,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So much sorrow never had creature<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That is, or shall (be), while the world may endure.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He is bereft of his sleep, his food, his drink<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So that he became lean and dry as is a stick;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;His eyes sunken and grisly to behold,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;His hue sickly yellow and pale as cold ashes,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And he was solitary and ever alone,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And wailing all the night, making his moan;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And if he heard song or instrument,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Then would he weep, he could not be stopped.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So feeble also were his spirits, and so low,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And changed so, that no man could know<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;His speech nor his voice, though men heard it.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And in his behavior for all the world he fared<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Not only like the lover's malady<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Of Hereos, but rather like mania,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Engendered by the melancholic humor <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In the front lobe, in his imagination.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And shortly, all was turned topsy-turvy<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Both the physical condition and also the mental disposition<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Of him, this woeful lover dan Arcite.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Why should I all daylong write of his woe?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When he had endured a year or two<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This cruel torment and this pain and woe,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;At Thebes, in his country, as I said,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Upon one night as he laid himself in sleep,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It seemed to him that the winged god Mercury<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Stood before him and commanded him to be merry.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;His sleep-inducing staff he carried upright in his hand;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He wore a hat upon his bright hair.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This god was dressed, as he (Arcite) noticed,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As he was when he put Argus to sleep;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And said to him thus: "To Athens shalt thou go,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Where an end of thy woe is destined for thee."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And with that word Arcite awoke and leaped up.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Now truly, however sorely it may pain me,"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Said he, "I will go to Athens right now,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nor shall I refrain for the dread of death <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;From seeing my lady, whom I love and serve.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In her presence I care not if I die."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And with that word he picked up a large mirror,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And saw that all his color was changed,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And saw his visage all (changed) to another sort.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And right away it ran to him in his mind,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That, since his face was so disfigured<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;By the malady which he had endured,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He might well, if he conducted himself humbly,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Live in Athens evermore unknown,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And see his lady almost every day.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And right away he changed his clothing,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And clad himself as a poor laborer,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And all alone, except only a squire<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Who knew his private affairs and all his situation,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Who was disguised as poorly as he was,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To Athens he is gone the nearest way.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And to the court he went upon a day,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And at the gate he offers his service<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To drudge and draw water, whatever men will command.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And shortly to speak of this matter,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He was given employment by a household attendant<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Who was dwelling with Emelye,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For he was wise and could soon take the measure<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Of every servant, who serves here.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He could well hew wood, and carry water,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For he was young and mighty indeed,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And moreover he was tall and strong of bones<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To do what any one can command him.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A year or two he was in this service,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Page of the chamber of Emelye the bright,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And he said that he was called Philostrate.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But half so well beloved a man as he<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Was never in court (anyone) of his rank;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He was so noble in manner<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That his fame was (spread) throughout all the court .<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;They said that it would be a act of charity<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;If Theseus would advance his rank,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And put him in noble employment,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Where he could exercise his abilities.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And thus within a short time his fame is sprung,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Both for his deeds and his good speech,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That Theseus has taken him so near<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That he has made him a squire of his chamber,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And gave him gold to maintain (a life style suitable to) his rank.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And also men brought him out of his country,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;From year to year, very secretly, his income;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But properly and slyly he spent it,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So that no man wondered how he acquired it.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And three years in this manner he led his life,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And conducted himself so that, in peace and also in war,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There was no man whom Theseus holds dearer.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And in this bliss I now leave Arcite,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And I will speak of Palamon a little.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In darkness and horrible and strong imprisonment<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;These seven years Palamon has sat <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Wasted by suffering, what for woe and for distress.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Who feels double pain and sadness<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But Palamon, whom love so afflicts<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That he goes mad, out of his wits because of woe?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And also moreover he is a prisoner<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Perpetually, not just for a year.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Who could rime in English properly<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;His martyrdom? In truth it is not I;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Therefore I pass on as quickly as I can.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It happened that in the seventh year, of May<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The third night (as old books say,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That tell all this story more fully),<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Whether it was by chance or fate --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As, when a thing is pre-ordained, it must be --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That soon after midnight Palamon,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With the help of a friend, broke out of his prison<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And flees the city as fast as he can go.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For he had so given his jailer drink <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Of a spiced and sweetened drink made of a certain wine,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With narcotics and pure opium of Thebes,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That all that night, though men would shake him,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The jailer slept; he could not awake.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And thus he flees as fast as ever he can.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The night was short and very close to the day<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So that by necessity he must hide himself,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And to a grove close by <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With fearful foot then stalks Palamon.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For, shortly, this was his idea:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That in that grove he would hide himself all day,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And in the night then he would take his way<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Toward Thebes, to pray his friends <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To help him to wage war on Theseus;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And shortly, he would either lose his life<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Or win Emelye to be his wife.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This is the purpose and his full intent.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Now I will turn again to Arcite,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That little knew how near his trouble was,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To which Fortune had brought him in the snare.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The busy lark, messenger of day,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Salutes the morning gray in her song,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And fiery Phoebus rises up so bright<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That all the orient laughs because of the light,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And with his rays dries in the groves<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The silver drops hanging on the leaves.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And Arcite, who in the royal court<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With Theseus is chief squire,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Is risen and looks on the merry day.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And to do his observance to May,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Meditating on the object of his desire,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He on a war horse, leaping about like the fire,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Has ridden into the fields to amuse himself,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Out of the court, about a mile or two.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And to the grove of which I told you <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;By chance he began to hold his way <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To make himself a garland of the branches,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Were it of woodbine or hawthorn leaves,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And loud he sang in the bright sun:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"May, with all thy flowers and thy greenery,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Welcome be thou, fair, fresh May,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In hope that I can get something green."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And from his war horse, with an eager heart,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He rushed into the grove hastily,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And in a path he roams up and down,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Where by chance this Palamon<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Was in a thicket, so that no man could see him,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For he was sorely afraid of his death.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In no way did he know that it was Arcite;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;God knows he would scarcely have believed it<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But truly it is said, since many years ago,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That "field has eyes and the wood has ears."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It is very good for a man to act calmly,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For every day people meet at unexpected times.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Arcite knows full little of his fellow,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Who was near enough to hear all his speech,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For in the thicket he sits now very still.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When Arcite had roamed all his fill,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And sung all the rondel cheerfully,<BR>
nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He fell suddenly into a state of anxiety,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As these lovers do in their strange manners,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Now in the tree top, now down in the briars,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Now up, now down, like a bucket in a well.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Exactly like the Friday, truly for to tell,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Now it shines, now it rains hard,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Just so can fickle Venus sadden<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The hearts of her folk; just as her day<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Is changeable, just so she changes her array.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Friday is seldom like all the rest of the week.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When Arcite had sung, he began to sigh<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And sat himself down without any more.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Alas," he said, "that day that I was born!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;How long, Juno, through thy cruelty,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Wilt thou make war on the city of Thebes?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Alas, to ruin is brought<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The royal blood of Cadmus and Amphion --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Of Cadmus, who was the first man<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Who built Thebes, before the town first began,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And first was crowned king of the city.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I am of his lineage and his offspring<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;By true lineage, of the royal family,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And now I am so wretched and so enslaved,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That he who is my mortal enemy,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I meekly serve him as his squire.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And yet Juno does me much more shame,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For I dare not acknowledge my own name;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But whereas I was accustomed to be called Arcite,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Now I am called Philostrate, not worth a penny.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Alas, thou fierce Mars! Alas, Juno!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Thus has your anger destroyed all our lineage,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Save only me and wretched Palamon,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Whom Theseus torments in prison.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And in addition to all this, to slay me utterly<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Love has his fiery dart so ardently<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Stabbed through my faithful, sorrowful heart<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That my death was destined before my first garment was made.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;You slay me with your eyes, Emelye!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;You are the cause by which I die.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Of all the rest of my other troubles<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I do not reckon at the value of a weed,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Provided that I could do anything to please you."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And with that word he fell down in a trance<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A long time, and afterwards he leaped up.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This Palamon, that thought that through his heart<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He felt a cold sword suddenly glide,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For anger he trembled; no longer would he wait.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And when he had heard Arcite's tale,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As if he were mad, with face dead and pale,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He leaped up out of the thick bushes <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And said: "Arcite, false, wicked traitor,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Now art thou taken, who lovest my lady so,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For whom that I have all this pain and woe,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And art of my blood, and sworn to be in my confidence,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As I full often have told thee before now,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And hast tricked here duke Theseus,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And thus hast falsely changed thy name!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I will be dead, or else thou shalt die.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Thou shalt not love my lady Emelye,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But I will love her only and no other;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For I am Palamon, thy mortal foe.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And though I have no weapon in this place,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But out of prison am escaped by good luck,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I doubt not that either thou shalt dye,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Either thou shalt not love Emelye,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Choose which thou wish, or thou shalt not escape!"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This Arcite, with full spiteful heart,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When he knew him, and had heard his tale,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As fierce as a lion pulled out his sword,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And said thus: "By God who sits above,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Were it not that thou art sick and mad for love,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And also because thou hast no weapon in this place,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Thou shouldest never walk out of this grove,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Rather thou shouldest die of my hand. <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For I repudiate the pledge and the bond<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Which thou sayest that I have made to thee.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Lo! True fool, think well that love is free,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And I will love her in spite of all thy might!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But for as much as thou art a worthy knight<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And desire to decide the right to her by battle,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Have here my pledge; tomorrow I will not fail,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Without the knowledge of any other person,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But here I will be found as a knight,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And bring armor right enough for thee;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And choose the best, and leave the worst for me.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And food and drink this night will I bring<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Enough for thee, and bed-clothes for thy bedding.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And if it so be that thou win my lady,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And slay me in this wood where I am in,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Thou mayest well have thy lady as far as I am concerned."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This Palamon answered, "I agree."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And thus they are departed until morning,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When each of them had laid his faith as a pledge.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;O Cupid, devoid of all kindness to others!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;O reign, that will have no partner with thee!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Full truly it is said that love nor lordship<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Will not, willingly, have any partnership.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Arcite and Palamon well find that (to be true).<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Arcite has ridden immediately into the town,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And on the morning, before it was day's light,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Very secretly he has prepared two sets of armor,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Both sufficient and suitable to decide<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The battle in the field between them two;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And on his horse, alone as he was born,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He carries all the armor before him.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And in the grove, at time and place set,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This Arcite and this Palamon are met.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The color in their faces began to change;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Just as the hunters in the reign of Thrace,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He who stands at the gap in the forrest with a spear,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When the lion or the bear is hunted,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And hears him come rushing in the bushes,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And breaks both boughs and the leaves,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And thinks, "Here comes my mortal enemy!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Without fail, he must be dead, or I,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For either I must slay him at the gap,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Or he must slay me, if I suffer misfortune."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So fared they in changing colors of their faces,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When each of them knew the other.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There was no 'good day,' nor no salutations,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But straightway, without word or conversing,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Each one of them helped to arm the other<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As friendly as if he were his own brother;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And after that, with sharp strong spears <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;They thrust at each other a wonderfully long time.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Thou mightest suppose that this Palamon<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In his fighting was a mad lion,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And Arcite was like a cruel tiger;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;They began to smite like wild boars,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That froth at the mouth white as foam for mad anger. <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;They fought up to the ankle in their blood.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And in this manner I leave them to remain fighting,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And forth I will tell you of Theseus.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The destiny, general minister,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That executes in the world everywhere<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The providence that God has foreseen,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So strong it is that, though the world had sworn<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The contrary of a thing by yes or no,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Yet sometimes it shall happen on one day<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That happens not again in a thousand years. <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For certainly, our desires here,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Be it of war, or peace, or hate, or love,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;All this is ruled by the foresight above.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I mean this now in regard to mighty Theseus,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Who is so desirous to hunt,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And especially at the large hart in May,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That in his bed there dawns for him no day<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That he is not clad, and ready to ride<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With huntsman and horn and hounds beside him.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For in his hunting he has such delight<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That it is all his joy and desire<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To be himself the large hart's slayer,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For next to Mars he now serves Diana.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The day was clear, as I have told before this,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And Theseus with all joy and bliss,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With his Ypolita, the faire queen,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And Emelye, clothed all in green,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;On hunting they are ridden royally.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And to the grove that stood very close by,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In which there was a hart, so people told him,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Duke Theseus has held the straight way.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And directly to the glade he rides,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For through there the hart was accustomed to take his escape,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And (flee) over a brook, and so forth on his way.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This duke will have a run or two at him<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With such hounds as he pleases to command.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And when this duke was come unto the glade,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He looks toward the sun, and immediately<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He was aware of Arcite and Palamon,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Who fought as fiercely as if it were two wild boars.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The bright swords went to and fro<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So hideously that with the weakest stroke<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It seemed as if it would fell an oak.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But who they were, he knew nothing.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This duke smote his warhorse with his spurs,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And with a sudden leap he was between them two,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And pulled out a sword and cried, "Stop!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;No more, on the penalty of the loss of your head!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;By mighty Mars, he shall at once be dead<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Who smites any stroke that I can see.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But tell me what sort of men you are,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Who are so bold as to fight here<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Without judge or other officer,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As it would be in a properly conducted duel,"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This Palamon answered hastily<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And said, "Sire, what more words are needed?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We have deserved the death, both of us two.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Two woeful wretches are we, two miserable people,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Who are burdened down by our own lives;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And as thou art a rightful lord and judge,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Give us neither mercy nor refuge,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But slay me first, by holy charity!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But slay my fellow also as well as me;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Or slay him first, for though thou little knowest it,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This is thy mortal foe, this is Arcite,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Who is banished from thy land on (pain of losing) his head,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For which he has deserved to be dead.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For this is he that came unto thy gate<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And said that he was called  Philostrate.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Thus has he tricked thee for many years,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And thou hast made him thy chief squire;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And this is he that loves Emelye.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For since the day is come that I must dye,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I make plainly my confession<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That I am that same woeful Palamon<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That wickedly has broken (out of) thy prison.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I am thy mortal foe, and it is I<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Who loves the beautiful Emelye so passionately <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That I will die at this moment in her sight.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Therefore I ask death and my judicial sentence;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But slay my fellow in the same way,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For we have both deserved to be slain."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This worthy duke answered at once in reply,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And said, "This is a brief (easy) decision. <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Your own mouth, by your confession,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Has condemned you, and I will pronounce it;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There is no deed to torture you with the cord.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;You shall be dead, by mighty Mars the red!"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The queen at once, for true womanliness,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Began to weep, and so did Emelye,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And all the ladies in the company.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Great pity was it, as it seemed to them all,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That ever such a misfortune should occur,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For they were gentle men of high rank,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And this debate was for nothing but love;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And saw their bloody wounds wide and sore,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And all cried, both low ranking and high,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Have mercy, Lord, upon all of us women!"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And they fall down on their bare knees <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And would have kissed his feet there where he stood;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Until at the last his mood was calmed,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For pity comes soon to a gentle heart.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And though he first for anger shook and trembled,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He has considered shortly, in brief,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The trespass of them both, and also the cause,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And although his anger reproached them for their guilt,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Yet in his reason he excused them both,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As thus: he thought well that every man<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Will help himself in love, if he can,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And also deliver himself out of prison.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And also his heart had compassion<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Of women, for they weep continually,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And in his gentle heart he thought straightway,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And softly to himself he said, "Fie<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Upon a lord that will have no mercy,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But be a lion, both in word and deed,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To those who are in repentance and fear,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As well as to a proud, spiteful man<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Who will persist in what he first began.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That lord has little sound judgment,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That in such cases knows no distinctions<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But considers pride and humility equal."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And shortly, when his anger is thus gone,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He began to look up with bright eyes <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And spoke these same words all aloud:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"The god of love, ah, bless my soul!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;How mighty and how great a lord is he!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Against his power there avail no obstacles.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He may be called a god for his miracles,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For he can make, as he pleases,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Of every heart whatever he wants to devise.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Lo here this Arcite and this Palamon,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Who freely were out of my prison,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And could have lived royally in Thebes,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And know I am their mortal enemy,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And that their death lies in my power also,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And yet has Love, despite anything they could do,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Brought them both hither to die.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Now look, is that not a great folly?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Who can be a fool unless he is in love?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Behold, for the sake of God who sits above,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;See how they bleed! Are they not in fine condition?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Thus has their lord, the god of love, paid<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Their wages and their fees for their service!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And yet they consider themselves very wise,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Those who serve love, whatever may happen.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But this is yet the best joke of all,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That she for whom they have this sport<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Owes them as much gratitude for this as she owes me.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She knows no more of all this passionate business,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;By God, than knows a cuckoo or a hare!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But all must be tried, hot or cold; <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A man must be a fool, either young or old --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I know it by my own experience very long ago,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For in my time I was a servant (of love).<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And therefore, since I know of love's pain<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And know how sorely it can afflict a man,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As one who has been often caught in its snare,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I wholly forgive you this trespass,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;At the request of the queen, who kneels here,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And also of Emelye, my dear sister.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And you must both immediately swear unto me <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That you shall never more harm my country,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nor make war upon me at any time,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But be my friends in all that you can.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I forgive you this trespass completely."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And they fairly and well swore to him (to do) his request,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And prayed him to be their lord and to have mercy ,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And he grants them his favor, and thus he said:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"To speak of royal lineage and riches,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Though she were a queen or a princess,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Each of you both is worthy, doubtless,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To wed when it is time; but none the less --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I speak for my sister Emelye,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For whom you have this strife and jealousy --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;You know yourself she can not wed two<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;At once, though you were to fight for evermore,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That one of you, whether he likes it or not, <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He must go whistle in an ivy leaf;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This is to say, she can not now have both,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Although you be never so jealous nor so angry.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And therefore I put you in this situation,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That each of you shall have his destiny<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As is ordained for him, and listen in what way;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Lo, hear what I shall arrange for your fate.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;My will is this, for flat conclusion,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Without any arguing --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;If this pleases you, take it for the best:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That each one of you shall go where he pleases<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Freely, without ransom or resistance,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And fifty weeks from this day, more or less,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Each one of you shall bring a hundred knights<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Armed up for the lists in all respects,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;All ready to decide the right to her by battle.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And this I promise you without fail,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Upon my word, and as I am a knight,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That whichever of you both who has the power --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This is to say, that whether he or thou<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Can with his hundred, as I spoke of now,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Slay his opponent, or drive him out of the lists ,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Then I shall give Emelye as wife<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To whom Fortune gives so good a gift (to win the battle).	<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I shall make the lists in this place,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And as God may surely have pity on my soul<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I shall be an impartial and true judge.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;You shall make no other agreement with me,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(Save this:) that one of you must be dead or taken.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And if it seems to you that this is well said,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Say your opinion, and consider yourself satisfied.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This is your (destined) end and your conclusion."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Who but Palamon looks happy now?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Who springs up for joy but Arcite?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Who could tell, or who could describe in writing,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The joy that is made in the place<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When Theseus has behaved so graciously?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But down on knees went every sort of person,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And thanked him with all their heart and might,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And especially the Thebans many times.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And thus with good hope and with happy heart<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;They take their leave, and homeward did they ride<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To Thebes with his old wide walls.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Experience, though no written authority<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Were in this world, is good enough for me<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To speak of the woe that is in marriage;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For, gentlemen, since I was twelve years of age,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thanked be God who is eternally alive,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I have had five husbands at the church door --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If I so often might have been wedded --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And all were worthy men in their way.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But to me it was told, certainly, it is not long ago,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That since Christ went never but once<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To a wedding, in the Cana of Galilee,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That by that same example he taught me<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That I should be wedded but once.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Listen also, lo, what a sharp word for this purpose,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Beside a well, Jesus, God and man,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Spoke in reproof of the Samaritan:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; `Thou hast had five husbands,' he said,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; `And that same man that now has thee<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Is not thy husband,' thus he said certainly.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What he meant by this, I can not say;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But I ask, why the fifth man<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Was no husband to the Samaritan?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; How many might she have in marriage?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I never yet heard tell in my lifetime<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A definition of this number.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Men may conjecture and interpret in every way,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But well I know, expressly, without lie,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; God commanded us to grow fruitful and multiply;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That gentle text I can well understand.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Also I know well, he said my husband<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Should leave father and mother and take to me.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But he made no mention of number,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of marrying two, or of marrying eight;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Why should men then speak evil of it?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Lo, (consider) here the wise king, dan Salomon;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I believe he had wives more than one.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As would God it were lawful unto me<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To be refreshed half so often as he!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What a gift of God he had because of all his wives!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; No man that in this world is alive has such (a gift).<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; God knows, this noble king, according to my judgment,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The first night had many a merry fit<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With each of them, so well things went for him in his lifetime.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Blessed be God that I have wedded five!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; [Of which I have picked out the best,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Both of their lower purse (scrotum) and of their strongbox.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Differing schools make perfect clerks,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And differing practice in many various works<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Makes the workman truly perfect;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of five husbands' schooling am I.]<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Welcome the sixth, whenever he shall appear.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For truly, I will not keep myself chaste in everything.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When my husband is gone from the world,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Some Christian man shall wed me straightway,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For then the apostle says that I am free<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To wed, by God's side (I swear), wherever it pleases me.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He says that to be wedded is no sin;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It is better to be wedded than to burn.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What do I care, though folk speak evil<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of cursed Lamech and his bigamy?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I know well Abraham was a holy man,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And Jacob also, insofar as I know;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And each of them had more than two wives,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And many another holy man also.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Where can you find, in any historical period,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That high God forbad marriage<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; By express word? I pray you, tell me.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or where commanded he virginity?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I know as well as you, it is no doubt,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The apostle, when he speaks of maidenhood,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He said that he had no precept concerning it.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Men may advise a woman to be one,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But advice is no commandment.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He left it to our own judgment;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For had God commanded maidenhood,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Then had he damned marriage along with the act (of procreation).<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And certainly, if there were no seed sown,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Then from what should virginity grow?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In any case, Paul dared not command<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A thing of which his master gave no command.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The prize is set up for virginity;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Catch it whoever can, let's see who runs best.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But this word does not apply to every person,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But where God desires to give it by his power.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I know well that the apostle was a virgin;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But nonetheless, though he wrote and said<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He would that every person were such as he,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; All is nothing but advice to (adopt) virginity. <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And he gave me leave to be a wife <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; By explicit permission; so it is not blameful<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To wed me, if my mate should die,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Without objection on the grounds of bigamy.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Although it would be good to touch no woman --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He meant in his bed or in his couch,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For it is perilous to assemble both fire and flax;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You know what this example may apply to.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This is the sum of it: he held virginity<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; More perfect than wedding in weakness.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Weakness I call it, unless he and she<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Would lead all their life in chastity.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I grant it well; I have no envy,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Though maidenhood may have precedence over a second marriage.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It pleases them to be clean, body and spirit;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of my state I will make no boast,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For well you know, a lord in his household,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He has not every utensil all of gold;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Some are of wood, and do their lord service.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; God calls folk to him in various ways,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And each one has of God an individual gift --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Some this, some that, as it pleases Him to provide.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Virginity is great perfection,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And continence also with devotion,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But Christ, who is the source of perfection,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Did not command that every one should go sell<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; All that he had, and give it to the poor,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And in such wise follow him and his footsteps.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He spoke to those who would live perfectly;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And gentlemen, by your leave, I am not that.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I will bestow the flower of all my age<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In the acts and in fruit of marriage.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Tell me also, to what purpose<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Were members of generation made,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And by so perfectly wise a Workman wrought?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Trust right well, they were not made for nothing.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Interpret whoever will, and say both up and down<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That they were made for purgation<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of urine, and both our small things <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Were also to know a female from a male,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And for no other cause -- do you say no?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The experience knows well it is not so.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Provided that the clerks be not angry with me,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I say this: that they are made for both;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That is to say, for urination and for ease<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of procreation, in which we do not displease God.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Why else should men set in their books <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That man shall pay to his wife her debt?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Now with what should he make his payment,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If he did not use his blessed instrument? <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Then were they made upon a creature<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To purge urine, and also for procreation.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But I say not that every person is required,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That has such equipment as I to you told,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To go and use them in procreation.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Then should men have no regard for chastity.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Christ was a virgin and shaped like a man,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And many a saint, since the world began;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Yet lived they ever in perfect chastity.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I will envy no virginity.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Let them be bread of pure wheat-seed,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And let us wives be called barley-bread;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And yet with barley-bread, Mark can tell it,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Our Lord Jesus refreshed many a man.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In such estate as God has called us<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I will persevere; I am not fussy.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In wifehood I will use my instrument<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As freely as my Maker has it sent.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If I be niggardly, God give me sorrow!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; My husband shall have it both evenings and mornings,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When it pleases him to come forth and pay his debt.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A husband I will have -- I will not desist --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who shall be both my debtor and my slave,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And have his suffering also <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Upon his flesh, while I am his wife.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I have the power during all my life<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Over his own body, and not he.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Right thus the Apostle told it unto me,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And commanded our husbands to love us well.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; All this sentence pleases me every bit" --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Up sprang the Pardoner, and that at once;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Now, madam," he said, "by God and by Saint John!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You are a noble preacher in this case.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I was about to wed a wife; alas!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Why should I pay for it so dearly on my flesh?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Yet would I rather wed no wife this year!"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Wait!" she said, "my tale is not begun.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Nay, thou shalt drink from another barrel,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Before I go, which shall taste worse than ale.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And when I have told thee forth my tale<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of suffering in marriage, <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of which I am expert in all my life -- <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This is to say, myself have been the whip --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Than may thou choose whether thou will sip<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of that same barrel that I shall open.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Beware of it, before thou too near approach;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For I shall tell examples more than ten.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; `Whoever will not be warned by (the examples of) other men,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Shall be an example by which other men shall be corrected.'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The same words writes Ptholomy;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Read in his Almagest, and take it there."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Madam, I would pray you, if it were your will,"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Said this Pardoner, "as you began,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Tell forth your tale, refrain for no man,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And teach us young men of your practice."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Gladly," she said, "since it may please you;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But yet I pray to all this company,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If I speak according to my fancy,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Do not be annoyed by what I say,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For my intention is only to amuse.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Now, sir, now will I tell forth my tale.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As ever may I drink wine or ale,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I shall speak the truth; those husbands that I had,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Three of them were good, and two were bad.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The three were good men, and rich, and old;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Hardly might they the statute hold (pay the debt)<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In which they were bound unto me.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You know well what I mean of this, by God!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So help me God, I laugh when I think<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; How pitifully at night I made them work!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And, by my faith, I set no store by it.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They had given me their land and their treasure;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I needed not work hard any longer<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To win their love, or do them reverence.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They loved me so well, by God above,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That I reckoned little of their love!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A wise woman will be constantly busy<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To get their love, yes, when she has none.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But since I had them wholly in my hand,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And since they had me given all their land,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Why should I take care to please them,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Unless it were for my profit and my pleasure?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I set them so to work, by my faith,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That many a night they sang `Woe is me!'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The bacon was not fetched for them, I believe,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That some men have in Essex at Dunmowe.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I governed them so well, according to my law,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That each of them was very blissful and eager<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To bring me gay things from the fair.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They were very glad when I spoke to them pleasantly,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For, God knows it, I cruelly scolded them.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Now listen how well I conducted myself,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You wise wives, that can understand.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thus should you speak and accuse them wrongfully,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For half so boldly can there no man<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Swear and lie, as a woman can.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I do not say this concerning wives that are wise,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Unless it be when they are ill advised.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A wise wife, if she knows what is good for her,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Shall deceive him by swearing the bird is crazy, <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And prove it by taking witness of her own maid <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who is in league with her. But listen how I spoke: <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; `Sir old doddering fool, is this thy doing? <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Why is my neighbor's wife so gay?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She is honored everywhere she goes;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I sit at home; I have no decent clothing.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What dost thou at my neighbor's house?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Is she so fair? Art thou so amorous?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What do you whisper with our maid? Bless me!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Sir old lecher, let thy tricks be! <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And if I have a close friend or an acquaintance,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Innocently, thou scold like a fiend,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If I walk or go unto his house to amuse myself!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thou comest home as drunk as a mouse,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And preach on thy bench, bad luck to you!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thou sayest to me it is a great misfortune<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To wed a poor woman, because of expense;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And if she be rich, of high birth,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Then thou sayest that it is a torment<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To put up with her pride and her angry moods.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And if she be fair, thou utter knave,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thou sayest that every lecher wants to have her;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She can not remain chaste for any length of time, <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who is assailed on every side.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thou sayest some folk desire us for riches,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Some for our shape, and some for our fairness,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And one because she can either sing or dance,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And some because of noble descent and flirtatious talk;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Some because of their hands and their slender arms;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thus goes all to the devil, according to you.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thou sayest men may not defend a castle wall,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It may so long be assailed on all sides.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And if she be ugly, thou sayest that she<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Covets every man that she may see,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For like a spaniel she will on him leap,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Until she find some man to buy (take) her.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Nor does any goose go there in the lake, no matter how drab,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That, thou sayest, will be without a mate.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And thou sayest it is a hard thing to control<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A thing that no man will, willingly, hold.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thus sayest thou, scoundrel, when thou goest to bed,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And that no wise man needs to wed,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Nor any man that hopes (to go) to heaven.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With wild thunder-bolt and fiery lightning<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; May thy wrinkled neck be broken in pieces!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thou sayest that leaky houses, and also smoke,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And scolding wives make men to flee<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Out of their own houses; ah, bless me!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What ails such an old man to chide like that?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thou sayest we wives will hide our vices <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Until we be securely tied (in marriage), and then we will them show --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Well may that be a proverb of a scoundrel!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thou sayest that oxen, asses, horses, and hounds,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They are tried out a number of times;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Basins, wash bowls, before men them buy,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Spoons and stools, and all such household items,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And so are pots, clothes, and adornments;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But folk of wives make no trial,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Until they are wedded -- old doddering scoundrel! --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And then, sayest thou, we will show our vices.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thou sayest also that it displeases me<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Unless thou will praise my beauty,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And unless thou peer always upon my face,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And call me "dear lady" in every place.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And unless thou make a feast on that same day<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That I was born, and make me happy and gay;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And unless thou do honor to my nurse,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And to my chambermaid within my bedchamber,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And to my father's folk and his allies --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thus sayest thou, old barrelful of lies!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And yet of our apprentice Janekin,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Because of his curly hair, shining like gold so fine,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And because he familiarly attends me everywhere,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Yet hast thou caught a false suspicion.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I do not want him, though thou were dead tomorrow!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But tell me this: why hidest thou, bad luck to you,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The keys of thy strongbox away from me?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It is my property as well as thine, by God!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What, think thou to make a fool of the lady of the house?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Now by that lord that is called Saint James,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thou shalt not both, though thou were crazy with anger,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Be master of my body and of my property;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; One of them thou must give up, despite anything you can do.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What helps it to inquire about me or spy?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I believe thou would lock me in thy strongbox!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thou should say, "Wife, go where you please;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Enjoy yourself; I will not believe any gossip.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I know you for a true wife, dame Alys."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We love no man who takes notice or concern about<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Where we go; we will be free (to do as we wish).<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of all men blessed may he be,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The wise astrologer, Dan Ptolemy,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who says this proverb in his Almagest:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Of all men his wisdom is the highest<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who never cares who has the world in his control."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; By this proverb thou shalt understand,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If thou have enough, why should thou take note or care<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; How merrily other folks fare?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For, certainly, old senile fool, by your leave,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You shall have pudendum right enough at eve. <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He is too great a miser that would refuse<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A man to light a candle at his lantern;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He shall have never the less light, by God.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If thou have enough, thou need not complain.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thou sayest also, that if we make ourselves gay<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With clothing, and with precious adornments,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That it is dangerous to our chastity;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And yet -- bad luck to thee! -- thou must reinforce thy argument,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And say these words in the Apostle's name:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "In clothing made with chastity and shame<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You women shall apparel yourselves," he said,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "And not in carefully arranged hair and gay precious stones,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Such as pearls, nor with gold, nor rich cloth."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In accordance with thy text, nor in accord with thy interpretation,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I will not do as much as a gnat.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thou said this, that I was like a cat;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For if anyone would singe a cat's skin,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Then would the cat well stay in his dwelling;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And if the cat's skin be sleek and gay,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She will not stay in house half a day,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But forth she will (go), before any day be dawned,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To show her skin and go yowling like a cat in heat. <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This is to say, if I be well dressed, sir scoundrel,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I will run out to show my poor clothes.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Sir old fool, what help is it for thee to spy?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Though thou pray Argus with his hundred eyes<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To be my bodyguard, as he best knows how,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In faith, he shall not keep me but as I please;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Yet could I deceive him, as I may prosper!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thou said also that there are three things,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The which things trouble all this earth,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And that no one can endure the fourth.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; O dear sir scoundrel, Jesus shorten thy life!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Yet thou preachest and sayest a hateful wife<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Is reckoned as one of these misfortunes.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Are there no other sorts of comparisons<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That you can use in your sayings, <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Without a poor wife's being one of them?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thou also compare women's love to hell,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To barren land, where water may not remain.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thou compare it also to Greek (inextinguishable) fire;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The more it burns, the more it has desire<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To consume every thing that will be burned.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thou sayest, just as worms destroy a tree,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Right so a wife destroys her husband;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This know they who are bound to wives.'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Gentlemen, right thus, as you have heard,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I firmly swore to my old husbands<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That thus they said in their drunkenness;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And all was false, but I took witness<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; On Janekin, and on my niece also.	<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; O Lord! The pain I did them and the woe,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Entirely guiltless (they were), by God's sweet pain!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For like a horse I could bite and whinny.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I could complain, and yet was in the wrong,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or else many times had I been ruined.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Whoever first comes to the mill, first grinds;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I complained first, so was our war ended.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They were very glad to excuse themselves quickly<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of things of which they were never guilty in their lives.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of wenches would I falsely accuse them,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When for sickness they could hardly stand.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Yet I tickled his heart, for he<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Believed that I had of him so great affection!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I swore that all my walking out by night<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Was to spy out wenches with whom he had intercourse;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Under that pretense I had many a mirth.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For all such wit is given us in our birth;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Deceit, weeping, spinning God has given<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To women naturally, while they may live.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And thus of one thing I boast:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; At the end I had the better in every way,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; By trickery, or force, or by some such thing, <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As by continual grumbling or grouching.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Especially in bed they had misfortune:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There would I scold and do them no pleasure;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I would no longer in the bed abide,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If I felt his arm over my side,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Until he had paid his penalty to me;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Then would I allow him to do his foolishness.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And therefore this tale I tell to every man,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Anyone can profit, for everything is for sale; <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; One can lure no hawks with an empty hand.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For profit I would endure all his lust,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And make me a feigned appetite;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And yet in bacon (old meat) I never had delight.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That made me so that I would always scold them,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For though the pope had sat beside them,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I would not spare them at their own table,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For, by my troth, I paid them back word for word.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As help me true God omnipotent,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Though I right now should make my will,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I owe them not one word that has not been avenged.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I brought it so about by my wit<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That they had to give it up, as the best they could do,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or else had we never been at peace;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For though he looked like a furious lion,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Yet should he fail to attain his goal.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Then I would say, `Sweetheart, see <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; How meekly looks Willy, our sheep!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Come near, my spouse, let me kiss thy cheek!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You should be all patient and meek,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And have a sweet tender disposition,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Since you so preach of Job's patience.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Suffer always, since you so well can preach;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And unless you do, certainly we shall teach you <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That it is fair to have a wife in peace.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; One of us two must bow, doubtless,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And since a man is more reasonable<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Than a woman is, you must be able to bear suffering.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What ails you to grouch thus and groan?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Is it because you want to have my pudendum all to yourself?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Why, take it all! Lo, have it every bit!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; By Saint Peter! I would curse you, if you did not love it well;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For if I would sell my `pretty thing,' <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I could walk as fresh (newly clothed) as is a rose;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But I will keep it for your own pleasure.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You are to blame, by God! I tell you the truth.'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Such sorts of words we had in hand. 	<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Now will I speak of my fourth husband.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; My fourth husband was a reveller --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This is to say, he had a mistress --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And I was young and full of playfulness,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Stubborn and strong, and jolly as a magpie.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; How well I could dance to a small harp,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And sing, indeed, like any nightingale,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When I had drunk a draft of sweet wine!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Metellius, the foul churl, the swine,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who with a staff deprived his wife of her life,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Because she drank wine, if I had been his wife,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He should not have frightened me away from drink!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And after wine on Venus must I think,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For as surely as cold engenders hail,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A gluttonous mouth must have a lecherous tail.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In drunken women there is no defense --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This lechers know by experience.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But -- Lord Christ! -- when I remember<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; My youth, and my gaiety,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It tickles me to the bottom of my heart.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Unto this day it does my heart good<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That I have had my world in my time.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But age, alas, that all will poison,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Has deprived me of my beauty and my vigor.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Let it go. Farewell! The devil go with it!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The flour is gone; there is no more to tell;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The bran, as I best can, now I must sell;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But yet I will try to be right merry.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Now will I tell of my fourth husband.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I say, I had in heart great anger<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That he had delight in any other.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But he was paid back, by God and by Saint Joce!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I made him a cross of the same wood;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Not of my body, in no foul manner,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But certainly, I treated folk in such a way <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That I made him fry in his own grease <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For anger, and for pure jealousy.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; By God, in earth I was his purgatory,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For which I hope his soul may be in glory.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For, God knows it, he sat very often and cried out in pain, <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When his shoe very bitterly pinched him.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There was no person who knew it, save God and he,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In many a way, how painfully I tortured him.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He died when I came from Jerusalem,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And lies buried under the rood beam, <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Although his tomb is not so elaborate<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As was the sepulcher of that Darius,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Which Appelles wrought skillfully;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It is nothing but waste to bury him expensively.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Let him fare well; God give his soul rest!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He is now in his grave and in his casket.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Now of my fifth husband I will tell.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; God let his soul never come in hell!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And yet he was to me the greatest scoundrel;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That feel I on my ribs one after another,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And ever shall unto my final day.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But in our bed he was so lively and gay,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And moreover he so well could deceive me,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When he would have my `pretty thing';<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That though he had beat me on every bone,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He could win back my love straightway.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I believe I loved him best, because he<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Was of his love standoffish to me. <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We women have, if I shall not lie,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In this matter a curious fantasy:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Note that whatever thing we may not easily have,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We will cry all day and crave for it.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Forbid us a thing, and we desire it;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Press on us fast, and then will we flee.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With niggardliness we spread out all our merchandise;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A great crowd at the market makes wares expensive,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And too great a supply makes them of little value: <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Every woman that is wise knows this.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; My fifth husband -- God bless his soul! --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Whom I took for love, and no riches,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He was formerly a clerk of Oxford,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And had left school, and came home to board<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With my close friend, dwelling in our town;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; God have her soul! Her name was Alisoun.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She knew my heart, and also my secrets,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Better than our parish priest, as I may prosper!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To her I revealed all my secrets.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For had my husband pissed on a wall,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or done a thing that should have cost his life,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To her, and to another worthy wife,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And to my niece, whom I loved well,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I would have told every one of his secrets.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And so I did very often, God knows it,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That made his face often red and hot<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For true shame, and blamed himself because he<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Had told to me so great a secret.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And so it happened that once in a Springtime --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Since frequently I went to visit my close friend, <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For I always loved to be gay,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And to walk in March, April, and May,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; From house to house, to hear various bits of gossip --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That Jankin the clerk, and my close friend dame Alys,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And I myself, into the fields went.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; My husband was at London all that Spring;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I had the better opportunity to amuse myself,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And to see, and also to be seen<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; By amorous folk. What did I know about where my good fortune <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Was destined to be, or in what place?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Therefore I made my visitations<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To religious feasts and to processions, <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To preaching also, and to these pilgrimages,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To plays about miracles, and to marriages,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And wore my gay scarlet robes.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; These worms, nor these moths, nor these mites,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Upon my peril (I swear), chewed on them never a bit;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And know thou why? Because they were well used.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Now will I tell forth what happened to me.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I say that in the fields we walked,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Until truly we had such flirtation,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This clerk and I, that for my provision for the future<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I spoke to him and said to him how he,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If I were a widow, should wed me.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For certainly -- I say this for no boast --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I was never yet without providing beforehand <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For marriage, nor for other things also.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I hold a mouse's heart not worth a leek<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That has but one hole to flee to,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If that should fail, then all is lost.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I falsely swore that he had enchanted me --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; My mother taught me that trick --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And also I said I dreamed of him all night,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He would have slain me as I lay on my back,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And all my bed was full of real blood; <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; `But yet I hope that you shall do me good,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For blood symbolizes gold, as I was taught.'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And all was false; I dreamed of it not at all, <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But I followed always my mother's teaching,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As well in this as in other things more.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But now, sir, let me see what I shall say.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A ha! By God, I have my tale again.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When my fourth husband was on the funeral bier,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I wept continuously, and acted sorry,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As wives must do, for it is the custom,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And with my kerchief covered my face,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But because I was provided with a mate,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I wept but little, and that I affirm.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To church was my husband carried in the morning<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; By neighbors, who for him made sorrow;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And Jankin, our clerk, was one of those.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As help me God, when I saw him go<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; After the bier, I thought he had a pair<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of legs and of feet so neat and fair<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That all my heart I gave unto his keeping.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He was, I believe, twenty years old,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And I was forty, if I shall tell the truth;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But yet I had always a colt's tooth.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With teeth set wide apart I was, and that became me well;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I had the print of Saint Venus's seal.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As help me God, I was a lusty one,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And fair, and rich, and young, and well fixed,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And truly, as my husbands told me,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I had the best pudendum that might be. <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For certainly, I am all influenced by Venus<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In feeling, and my heart is influenced by Mars.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Venus me gave my lust, my amorousness,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And Mars gave me my sturdy boldness;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; My ascendant was Taurus, and Mars was therein.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Alas, alas! That ever love was sin!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I followed always my inclination<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; By virtue of the state of the heavens at my birth;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That made me that I could not withdraw<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; My chamber of Venus from a good fellow.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Yet have I Mars' mark upon my face,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And also in another private place.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For as God may be my salvation,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I never loved in moderation,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But always followed my appetite,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Whether he were short, or tall, or black-haired, or blond;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I took no notice, provided that he pleased me,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; How poor he was, nor also of what rank.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What should I say but, at the month's end,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This jolly clerk, Jankin, that was so courteous,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Has wedded me with great solemnity,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And to him I gave all the land and property<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That ever was given to me before then.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But afterward I repented very bitterly;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He would not allow me anything of my desires.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; By God, he hit me once on the ear,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Because I tore a leaf out of his book,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So that of the stroke my ear became all deaf.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I was as stubborn as is a lioness,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And of my tongue a true chatterbox,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And I would walk, as I had done before,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; From house to house, although he had sworn the contrary;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For which he often times would preach,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And teach me of old Roman stories;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; How he, Simplicius Gallus, left his wife,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And forsook her for rest of all his life,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Because of nothing but because he saw her bare-headed<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Looking out at his door one day.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Another Roman he told me by name,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who, because his wife was at a midsummer revel<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Without his knowledge, he forsook her also.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And then he would seek in his Bible<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That same proverb of Ecclesiasticus<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Where he commands and strictly forbids that<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Man should suffer his wife go wander about.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Then would he say right thus, without doubt:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; `Whoever builds his house all of willow twigs,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And spurs his blind horse over the open fields,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And suffers his wife to go on pilgrimages,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Is worthy to be hanged on the gallows!'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But all for nothing, I gave not a hawthorn berry <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For his proverbs nor for his old sayings,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Nor would I be corrected by him.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I hate him who tells me my vices,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And so do more of us, God knows, than I.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This made him all utterly furious with me;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I would not put up with him in any way.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Now will I tell you the truth, by Saint Thomas,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Why I tore a leaf out of his book,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For which he hit me so hard that I was deaf.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He had a book that regularly, night and day,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For his amusement he would always read;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He called it Valerie and Theofrastus,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; At which book he always heartily laughed.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And also there was once a clerk at Rome,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A cardinal, who is called Saint Jerome,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That made a book against Jovinian;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In which book also there was Tertullian,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Crisippus, Trotula, and Heloise,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who was abbess not far from Paris,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And also the Parables of Salomon,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Ovid's Art, and many other books,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And all these were bound in one volume.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And every night and day was his custom,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When he had leisure and spare time<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; From other worldly occupations,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To read in this book of wicked wives.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He knew of them more legends and lives<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Than are of good women in the Bible.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For trust well, it is an impossibility<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That any clerk will speak good of women,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Unless it be of holy saints' lives,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Nor of any other woman in any way.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who painted the lion, tell me who?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; By God, if women had written stories,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As clerks have within their studies, <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They would have written of men more wickedness<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Than all the male sex could set right.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The children of Mercury (clerks) and of Venus (lovers)<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Are directly contrary in their actions;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Mercury loves wisdom and knowledge,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And Venus loves riot and extravagant expenditures.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And, because of their diverse dispositions,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Each falls in the other's most powerful astronomical sign.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And thus, God knows, Mercury is powerless<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In Pisces (the Fish), where Venus is exalted,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And Venus falls where Mercury is raised.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Therefore no woman is praised by any clerk.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The clerk, when he is old, and can not do<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Any of Venus's works worth his old shoe,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Then he sits down, and writes in his dotage<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That women can not keep their marriage!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But now to the point, why I told thee<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That I was beaten for a book, by God!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Upon a night Jankin, that was master of our house,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Read on his book, as he sat by the fire,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of Eve first, how for her wickedness<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; All mankind was brought to wretchedness,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For which Jesus Christ himself was slain,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who bought us back with his heart's blood.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Lo, here clearly of woman you may find<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That woman was the cause of the loss of all mankind.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Then he read me how Sampson lost his hair:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Sleeping, his lover cut it with her shears; <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Through which treason he lost both his eyes.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Then he read to me, if I shall not lie,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of Hercules and of his Dianyre,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who caused him to set himself on fire.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He forgot not a bit of the care and the woe<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That Socrates had with his two wives,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; How Xantippa caste piss upon his head.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This poor man sat still as if he were dead; <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He wiped his head, no more dared he say,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But `Before thunder stops, there comes a rain!'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of Phasipha, that was the queen of Crete,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For sheer malignancy, he thought the tale sweet;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Fie! Speak no more -- it is a grisly thing --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of her horrible lust and her pleasure.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of Clitermystra, for her lechery,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That falsely made her husband to die,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He read it with very good devotion.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He told me also for what occasion<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Amphiorax at Thebes lost his life.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; My husband had a legend of his wife,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Eriphilem, that for a brooch of gold<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Has secretly unto the Greeks told<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Where her husband hid him in a place,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For which he had at Thebes a sad fate.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of Livia told he me, and of Lucie:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They both made their husbands to die,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That one for love, that other was for hate.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Livia her husband, on a late evening,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Has poisoned, because she was his foe;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Lucia, lecherous, loved her husband so much<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That, so that he should always think upon her,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She gave him such a sort of love-drink<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That he was dead before it was morning;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And thus always husbands have sorrow.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Then he told me how one Latumius<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Complained unto his fellow Arrius<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That in his garden grew such a tree<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; On which he said how his three wives <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Hanged themselves for the malice of their hearts <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; `O dear brother,' this Arrius said,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; `Give me a shoot of that same blessed tree, <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And in my garden shall it be planted.'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of latter date, of wives has he read<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That some have slain their husbands in their bed,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And let her lecher copulate with her all the night,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When the corpse lay in the floor flat on its back.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And some have driven nails in their brains,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; While they slept, and thus they had them slain.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Some have given them poison in their drink.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He spoke more harm than heart may imagine,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And concerning this he knew of more proverbs<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Than in this world there grow grass or herbs.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; `Better is,' he said, `thy habitation<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Be with a lion or a foul dragon,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Than with a woman accustomed to scold.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Better is,' he said, `to stay high in the roof,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Than with an angry wife down in the house;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They are so wicked and contrary,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They always hate what their husbands love.'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He said, `A woman casts their shame away,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When she casts off her undergarment'; and furthermore,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; `A fair woman, unless she is also chaste,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Is like a gold ring in a sow's nose.'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who would believe, or who would suppose,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The woe that in my heart was, and pain?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And when I saw he would never cease<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Reading on this cursed book all night,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; All suddenly have I plucked three leaves <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Out of his book, right as he read, and also<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I with my fist so hit him on the cheek<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That in our fire he fell down backwards.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And he leaped up as does a furious lion,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And with his fist he hit me on the head<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That on the floor I lay as if I were dead.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And when he saw how still I lay,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He was frightened and would have fled on his way,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Until at the last out of my swoon I awoke.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; `O! hast thou slain me, false thief?' I said,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; `And for my land thus hast thou murdered me?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Before I am dead, yet will I kiss thee.'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And near he came, and kneeled gently down,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And said, `Dear sister Alisoun,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So help me God, I shall never (again) smite thee!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What I have done, it is thyself to blame (you drove me to it). <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Forgive it me, and that I beseech thee!'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And yet immediately I hit him on the cheek,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And said, `Thief, thus much am I avenged;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Now will I die, I may no longer speak.'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But at the last, with much care and woe,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We made an agreement between our two selves. 	<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He gave me all the control in my hand,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To have the governance of house and land,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And of his tongue, and of his hand also;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And made him burn his book immediately right then.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And when I had gotten unto me,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; By mastery, all the sovereignty,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And that he said, `My own true wife,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Do as you please the rest of all thy life;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Guard thy honor, and guard also my reputation' --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; After that day we never had an argument.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As God may help me, I was to him as kind<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As any wife from Denmark unto India,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And also true, and so was he to me.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I pray to God, who sits in majesty,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So bless his soul for his mercy dear.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Now will I say my tale, if you will hear."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Friar laughed, when he had heard all this;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Now dame," he said, "as I may have joy or bliss,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This is a long preamble of a tale!"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And when the Summoner heard the Friar cry out,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Lo," said the Summoner, "By God's two arms!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A friar will always intrude himself (in others' affairs).<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Lo, good men, a fly and also a friar<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Will fall in every dish and also every discussion.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What speakest thou of perambulation?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What! amble, or trot, or keep still, or go sit down!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thou spoil our fun in this manner."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Yes, wilt thou have it thus, sir Summoner?" said the Friar;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Now, by my faith I shall, before I go,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Tell of a summoner such a tale or two<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That all the folk shall laugh in this place."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Now otherwise, Friar, I curse thy face,"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Said this Summoner, "and I curse myself,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Unless I tell tales two or three<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of friars before I come to Siitingbourne<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That I shall make thy heart to mourn,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For well I know thy patience is gone."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Our Host cried "Peace! And that right now!"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And said, "Let the woman tell her tale.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You act like folk that are drunk on ale.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Do, dame, tell forth your tale, and that is best."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "All ready, sir," she said, "right as you please,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If I have permission of this worthy Friar."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Yes, dame," he said, "tell forth, and I will hear."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In the old days of King Arthur,	<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of whom Britons speak great honor,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This land was all filled full of supernatural creatures. <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The elf-queen, with her jolly company,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Danced very often in many a green mead.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This was the old belief, as I read;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I speak of many hundred years ago.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But now no man can see any more elves,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For now the great charity and prayers<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of licensed beggars and other holy friars,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That overrun every land and every stream,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As thick as specks of dust in the sun-beam,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Blessing halls, chambers, kitchens, bedrooms,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Cities, towns, castles, high towers,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Villages, barns, stables, dairies --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This makes it that there are no fairies.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For where an elf was accustomed to walk <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There walks now the licensed begging friar himself<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In late mornings and in early mornings,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And says his morning prayers and his holy things<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As he goes in his assigned district.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Women may go safely up and down.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In every bush or under every tree<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There is no other evil spirit but he,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And he will not do them any harm except dishonor.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And so it happened that this king Arthur<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Had in his house a lusty bachelor,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That on one day came riding from hawking,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And it happened that, alone as he was born,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He saw a maiden walking before him,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of which maiden straightway, despite all she could do,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; By utter force, he took away her maidenhead;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For which wrong was such clamor<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And such demand for justice unto king Arthur<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That this knight was condemned to be dead,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; By course of law, and should have lost his head --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Perhaps such was the statute then --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Except that the queen and other ladies as well<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So long prayed the king for grace<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Until he granted him his life right there,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And gave him to the queen, all at her will,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To choose whether she would him save or put to death.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The queen thanks the king with all her might,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And after this she spoke thus to the knight,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When she saw her time, upon a day:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Thou standest yet," she said, "in such condition,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That of thy life yet thou hast no assurance<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I grant thee life, if thou canst tell me<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What thing it is that women most desire.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Beware, and keep thy neck-bone from iron (axe)!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And if thou canst not tell it right now,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Yet I will give thee leave to go<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A twelvemonth and a day, to seek to learn<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A satisfactory answer in this matter;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And I will have, before thou go, a pledge <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To surrender thy body in this place."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Woe was this knight, and sorrowfully he sighs;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But what! He can not do all as he pleases.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And at the last he chose to leave<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And come again, exactly at the year's end,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With such answer as God would provide him;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And takes his leave, and goes forth on his way.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He seeks every house and every place<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Where he hopes to have the luck<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To learn what thing women love most,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But he could not arrive in any region<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Where he might find in this matter<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Two creatures agreeing together.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Some said women love riches best,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Some said honor, some said gaiety,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Some rich clothing, some said lust in bed,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And frequently to be widow and wedded.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Some said that our hearts are most eased<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When we are flattered and pleased.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He goes very near the truth, I will not lie.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A man shall win us best with flattery,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And with attentions and with solicitude<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We are caught, every one of us.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And some say that we love best<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To be free and do just as we please,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And that no man reprove us for our vices,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But say that we are wise and not at all silly.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For truly there is not one of us all,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If any one will scratch us on the sore spot, <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That we will not kick back, because he tells us the truth.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Try it, and whoever so does shall find it true;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For, be we never so vicious within,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We want to be considered wise and clean of sin.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And some say that we have great delight <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To be considered steadfast, and also (able to keep a) secret,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And in one purpose steadfastly to remain,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And not reveal things that men tell us.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But that tale is not worth a rake handle.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; By God, we women can hide nothing;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Witness on Midas -- will you hear the tale?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Ovid, among other small matters, <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Said Midas had, under his long hair,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Two ass's ears, growing upon his head,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The which vice he hid as he best could<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Very skillfully from every man's sight,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That, except for his wife, there knew of it no others.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He loved her most, and trusted her also;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He prayed her that to no creature<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She should tell of his disfigurement.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She swore him, "Nay"; for all this world to win,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She would not do that dishonor or sin,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To make her husband have so foul a reputation.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She would not tell it for her own shame.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But nonetheless, she thought that she would die<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If she should hide a secret so long;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She thought it swelled so sore about her heart<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That necessarily some word must escape her;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And since she dared tell it to no man,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She ran down to a marsh close by --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Until she came there her heart was afire --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And as a bittern bumbles in the mire,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She laid her mouth down unto the water:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Betray me not, thou water, with thy sound,"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She said; "to thee I tell it and no others;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; My husband has two long asses ears!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Now is my heart all whole; now is it out.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I could no longer keep it, without doubt."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Here you may see, though we a time abide,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Yet out it must come; we can hide no secret.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The remnant of the tale if you will hear,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Read Ovid, and there you may learn it.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This knight, of whom my tale is in particular,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When he saw he might not come to that --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This is to say, what women love most --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Within his breast very sorrowful was the spirit.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But home he goes; he could not linger;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The day was come that homeward he must turn.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And in his way he happened to ride,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In all this care, near a forest side,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Where he saw upon a dance go<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Ladies four and twenty, and yet more;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Toward the which dance he drew very eagerly,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In hope that he should learn some wisdom.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But certainly, before he came fully there,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Vanished was this dance, he knew not where.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He saw no creature that bore life,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Save on the green he saw sitting a woman --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There can no man imagine an uglier creature.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; At the knight's coming this old wife did rise,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And said, "Sir knight, there lies no road out of here.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Tell me what you seek, by your faith!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Perhaps it may be the better;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; These old folk know many things," she said.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "My dear mother," said this knight, "certainly<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I am as good as dead unless I can say<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What thing it is that women most desire.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If you could teach me, I would well repay you."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Pledge me thy word here in my hand," she said,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "The next thing that I require of thee,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thou shalt do it, if it lies in thy power,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And I will tell it to you before it is night."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Have here my pledged word," said the knight, "I agree."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Then," she said, "I dare me well boast<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thy life is safe, for I will stand thereby;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Upon my life, the queen will say as I.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Let's see which is the proudest of them all<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That wears a kerchief or a hairnet<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That dares say `nay' of what I shall teach thee.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Let us go forth without longer speech."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Then she whispered a message in his ear,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And commanded him to be glad and have no fear.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When they are come to the court, this knight<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Said he had held his day, as he had promised,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And his answer was ready, as he said.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Very many a noble wife, and many a maid,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And many a widow, because they are wise,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The queen herself sitting as a justice,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Are assembled, to hear his answer;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And afterward this knight was commanded to appear.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Silence was commanded to every person,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And that the knight should tell in open court<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What thing (it is) that worldly women love best.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This knight stood not silent as does a beast,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But to his question straightway answered<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With manly voice, so that all the court heard it:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "My liege lady, without exception," he said,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Women desire to have sovereignty<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As well over her husband as her love,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And to be in mastery above him.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This is your greatest desire, though you kill me.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Do as you please; I am here subject to your will."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In all the court there was not wife, nor maid,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Nor widow that denied what he said,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But said that he was worthy to have his life.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And with that word up sprang the old woman,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Whom the knight saw sitting on the green:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Mercy," she said, "my sovereign lady queen!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Before your court departs, do me justice.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I taught this answer to the knight;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For which he pledged me his word there,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The first thing that I would ask of him<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He would do, if it lay in his power.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Before the court then I pray thee, sir knight,"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Said she, "that thou take me as thy wife,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For well thou know that I have saved thy life.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If I say false, say `nay', upon thy faith!"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This knight answered, "Alas and woe is me!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I know right well that such was my promise.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For God's love, choose a new request!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Take all my goods and let my body go."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Nay, then," she said, "I curse both of us two!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For though I am ugly, and old, and poor<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I would not for all the metal, nor for ore<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That under earth is buried or lies above,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Have anything except that I were thy wife, and also thy love."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "My love?" he said, "nay, my damnation!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Alas, that any of my family<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Should ever be so foully degraded!"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But all for naught; the end is this, that he<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Constrained was; he must by necessity wed her,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And takes his old wife, and goes to bed.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Now would some men say, perhaps,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That because of my negligence I make no effort<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To tell you the joy and all the rich display<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That was at the (wedding) feast that same day.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To which thing shortly I shall answer:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I say there was no joy nor feast at all;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There was nothing but heaviness and much sorrow.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For he wedded her in private in the morning,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And all day after hid himself like an owl,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So woeful was he, his wife looked so ugly.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Great was the woe the knight had in his thought,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When he was brought to bed with his wife;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He wallows and he turns to and fro.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His old wife lay smiling evermore,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And said, "O dear husband, bless me!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Does every knight behave thus with his wife as you do?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Is this the law of king Arthur's house?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Is every knight of his so aloof?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I am your own love and your wife;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I am she who has saved your life,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And, certainly, I did you never wrong yet;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Why behave you thus with me this first night?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You act like a man who had lost his wit.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What is my offense? For God's love, tell it,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And it shall be amended, if I can."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Amended?" said this knight, "Alas, nay, nay!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It will not be amended ever more.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thou art so loathsome, and so old also,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And moreover descended from such low born lineage,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That little wonder is though I toss and twist about.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So would God my heart would burst!"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Is this," she said, "the cause of your distress?"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Yes, certainly," he said, "it is no wonder."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Now, sir," she said, "I could amend all this,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If I pleased, before three days were past,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Providing that you might behave well towards me.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "But, since you speak of such nobility<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As is descended out of old riches,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That therefore you should be noble men,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Such arrogance is not worth a hen.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Look who is most virtuous always,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In private and public, and most intends ever<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To do the noble deeds that he can;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Take him for the greatest noble man.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Christ wants us to claim our nobility from him,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Not from our ancestors for their old riches.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For though they give us all their heritage,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For which we claim to be of noble lineage,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Yet they can not bequeath by any means<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To any of us their virtuous living,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That made them be called noble men,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And commanded us to follow them in such matters.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Well can the wise poet of Florence,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who is called Dante, speak on this matter.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Lo, in such sort of rime is Dante's speech:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; `Very seldom grows up from its small branches<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Nobility of man, for God, of his goodness,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Wants us to claim our nobility from him';<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For from our ancestors we can claim no thing <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Except temporal things, that may hurt and injure a man.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Also every person knows this as well as I,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If nobility were planted naturally<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Unto a certain lineage down the line,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Then in private and in public they would never cease<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To do the just duties of nobility;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They could do no dishonor or vice.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Take fire and bear it in the darkest house<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Between this and the mount of Caucasus,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And let men shut the doors and go away;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Yet will the fire as brightly blaze and burn <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As if twenty thousand men might it behold;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Its natural function it will always hold,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; On peril of my life (I say), until it dies.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Here may you see well that nobility<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Is not joined with possession,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Since folk not do behave as they should<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Always, as does the fire, lo, in its nature.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For, God knows it, men may well often find<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A lord's son doing shame and dishonor;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And he who will have praise for his noble birth,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Because he was born of a noble house<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And had his noble and virtuous ancestors,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And will not himself do any noble deeds<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Nor follow his noble ancestry that is dead,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He is not noble, be he duke or earl,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For churlish sinful deeds make a churl.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For nobility is nothing but renown<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of thy ancestors, for their great goodness,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Which is a thing not naturally part of thy person.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thy nobility comes from God alone.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Then our true nobility comes from grace ;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It was not at all bequeathed to us with our social rank.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Think how noble, as says Valerius,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Was that same Tullius Hostillius,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That out of poverty rose to high nobility.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Read Seneca, and read also Boethius;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There shall you see clearly that it is no doubt<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That he is noble who does noble deeds.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And therefore, dear husband, I thus conclude:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Although it is so that my ancestors were rude,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Yet may the high God, and so hope I,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Grant me grace to live virtuously.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Then am I noble, when I begin<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To live virtuously and abandon sin.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "And whereas you reprove me for poverty,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The high God, on whom we believe,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In voluntary poverty chose to live his life.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And certainly every man, maiden, or woman<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Can understand that Jesus, heaven's king,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Would not choose a vicious form of living.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Glad poverty is an honest thing, certain;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This will Seneca and other clerks say.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Whoever considers himself satisfied with his poverty,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I consider him rich, although he had not a shirt.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He who covets is a poor person,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For he would have that which is not in his power;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But he who has nothing, nor covets to have anything,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Is rich, although you consider him but a knave.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; True poverty, it rightly sings; <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Juvenal says of poverty merrily:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; `The poor man, when he goes along the roadway,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Before the thieves he may sing and play.'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Poverty is a hateful good and, as I guess,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A very great remover of cares;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A great amender also of wisdom<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To him that takes it in patience.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Poverty is this, although it may seem miserable:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A possession that no one will challenge.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Poverty very often, when a man is low,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Makes him know his God and also himself.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Poverty is an eye glass, as it seems to me,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Through which one may see his true friends.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And therefore, sir, since I do not injure you,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You (should) no longer reprove me for my poverty.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Now, sir, of old age you reprove me;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And certainly, sir, though no authority<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Were in any book, you gentlefolk of honor<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Say that men should be courteous to an old person<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And call him father, because of your nobility;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And authors shall I find, as I guess.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Now where you say that I am ugly and old,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Than do not fear to be a cuckold;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For filth and old age, as I may prosper,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Are great guardians of chastity.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But nonetheless, since I know your delight,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I shall fulfill your worldly appetite.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Choose now," she said, "one of these two things:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To have me ugly and old until I die,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And be to you a true, humble wife,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And never displease you in all my life,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or else you will have me young and fair,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And take your chances of the crowd<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That shall be at your house because of me,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or in some other place, as it may well be.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Now choose yourself, whichever you please."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This knight deliberates and painfully sighs,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But at the last he said in this manner:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "My lady and my love, and wife so dear,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I put me in your wise governance;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Choose yourself which may be most pleasure<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And most honor to you and me also.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I do not care which of the two,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For as it pleases you, is enough for me."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Then have I gotten mastery of you," she said,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Since I may choose and govern as I please?"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Yes, certainly, wife," he said, "I consider it best."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Kiss me," she said, "we are no longer angry,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For, by my troth, I will be to you both --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This is to say, yes, both fair and good.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I pray to God that I may die insane<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Unless I to you be as good and true<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As ever was wife, since the world was new.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And unless I am tomorrow morning as fair to be seen<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As any lady, empress, or queen,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That is between the east and also the west,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Do with my life and death right as you please.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Cast up the curtain, look how it is."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And when the knight saw truly all this,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That she so was beautiful, and so young moreover,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For joy he clasped her in his two arms.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His heart bathed in a bath of bliss.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A thousand time in a row he did her kiss,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And she obeyed him in every thing<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That might do him pleasure or enjoyment.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And thus they live unto their lives' end<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In perfect joy; and Jesus Christ us send<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Husbands meek, young, and vigorous in bed,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And grace to outlive them whom we wed;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And also I pray Jesus shorten their lives<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That will not be governed by their wives;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And old and angry misers in spending,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; God send them soon the very pestilence!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Which is called Bobbe-up-and-down,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Under the Blee, in Canterbury Way?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There began our Host to joke and play,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And said, "Sirs, what! Dun is in the mire!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Is there no man, for prayer nor for hire,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That will awake our fellow far behind us?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A thief might full easily rob and bind him.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; See how he naps! See how, for cock's bones,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That he will soon fall from his horse!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Is that a cook of London, with bad luck (to him)?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Make him come forth, he knows his penance;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For he shall tell a tale, by my faith,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Although it be not worth a bundle of hay.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Awake, thou Cook," said he, "God give thee sorrow!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What ails thee to sleep in the morning?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Hast thou had fleas all night, or art thou drunk?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or hast thou with some prostitute all night labored,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So that thou can not hold up thy head?"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This Cook, who was full pale and not at all red,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Said to our Host, "God bless my soul,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There is fallen on me such heaviness,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Know I not why, that I would rather sleep<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Than  (have) the best gallon of wine in Cheapside."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Well," said the Manciple, "if it may give relief<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To thee, sir Cook, and be displeasing to no person,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who rides here in this company,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And (providing) that our Host would (agree), of his courtesy,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I will for now excuse thee of thy tale.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For, in good faith, thy visage is full pale,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thy eyes are dazed also, as it seems to me,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And, well I know, thy breath full sourly stinks:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That shows well thou art not in good health.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; By me, certainly, thou shalt not be deceived.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; See how he yawns, lo, this drunken fellow,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As though he would swallow us right away.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Keep thy mouth closed, man, by thy father's kin!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The devil of hell set his foot therein!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thy cursed breath would infect us all.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Fie, stinking swine! Fie, may foul fortune thee befall!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Ah, take heed, sirs, of this lusty man.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Now, sweet sir, will you joust at the quintain? <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It seems to me you are in good shape for that!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I believe that you have drunk until you act like an ape,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And that is when men play with a straw."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And with this speech the Cook became angry and enraged,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And on the Manciple he began to shake his head fast<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For lack of speech, and down the horse him threw,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Where he lay, until men lifted him up.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This was a fine feat of horsemanship by a cook!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Alas, he had not kept himself by his ladle (i.e., stayed home)!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And before he was again in his saddle,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There was great shoving both to and fro<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To lift him up, and much care and woe,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So unwieldy was this sorry enfeebled soul.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And to the Manciple then spoke our Host:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Because drink has domination<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Upon this man, by my salvation,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I believe he would tell his tale badly.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For, were it wine or old or new ale<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That he has drunk, he speaks in his nose,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And sneezes fast, and also he has a head cold.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "He has also more than enough to do <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To keep him and his horse out of the mud;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And if he fall from his horse again,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Then shall we all have enough to do<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In lifting up his heavy drunken body.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Tell on thy tale; of him I take no account.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "But yet, Manciple, in faith thou art too foolish,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thus openly to reprove him of his vice.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Another day he would, perhaps,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Recall thee and bring thee to the lure (like a hawk);<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I mean, he would speak of small things,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As for to find fault with thy accounts,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That may not be honest, if it comes to proof."  <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "No," said the Manciple, "that would be a great mischief!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In that way he could easily bring me into the trap.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Yet I would rather pay for the mare<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That he rides on, than he should strive with me.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I will not anger him, as I may thrive!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That which I spoke, I said it in my joking.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And do you know what? I have here in a gourd<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A draught of wine, yes, of a ripe grape,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And right away you shall see a good joke.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This Cook shall drink thereof, if I may.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Upon pain of death, he will not say me nay."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And certainly, to tell it as it was,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of this vessel the Cook drank fast, alas!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Why did he need that? He drank enough before.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And when he had blown in this horn,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To the Manciple he gave the gourd again;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And of that drink the Cook was wonderfully pleased,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And thanked him in such a way as he could.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Then began our Host to laugh wonderfully loud,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And said, "I see well it is necessary,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Wherever we go, to carry good drink with us;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For that will turn rancor and strife<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To accord and love, and appease many a wrong.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "O Bacchus, blessed be thy name,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who so can turn earnest into game!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Worship and thanks be to thy deity!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of that matter you get no more of me.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Tell on thy tale, Manciple, I thee pray."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Well, sir," said he, "now hearken what I say."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When Phoebus dwelled down here in this earth,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As old books make mention,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He was the most lusty bachelor<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In all this world, and also the best archer.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He slew Phitoun, the serpent, as he lay<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Sleeping in the sun upon a day;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And many another noble worthy deed<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He wrought with his bow, as men may read.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He could play on every minstrelsy,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And sing so that it was a pleasure<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To hear of his clear voice the sound.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Certainly the king of Thebes, Amphioun,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who with his singing walled that city,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Could never sing half so well as he.  <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thereto he was the best looking man<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That is or was since the world began.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What needs it his features to describe?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For in this world was no one so handsome alive.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He was therewith filled full of nobility,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of honor, and of perfect worthiness.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This Phoebus, which was the flower of knighthood,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As well in generosity as in chivalry,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For his amusement, in sign also of victory<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Over Phitoun, as tells us the story,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Was accustomed to bear in his hand a bow.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Now had this Phoebus in his house a crow<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Which in a cage he fostered many a day,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And taught it to speak, as men teach a jay.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; White was this crow as is a snow-white swan,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And imitate the speech of every man<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He could, when he should tell a tale.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Therewith in all this world no nightingale<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Could not, by a hundred thousand times,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Sing so wonderfully merrily and well.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Now had this Phoebus in his house a woman<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Whom he loved more than his life,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And night and day did ever his efforts<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To please her and do her reverence,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Save only, if I shall say the truth,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Jealous he was, and would eagerly have kept her.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For he was loath to be tricked,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And so is every person in such a situation;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But all in vain, for it does not help.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A good wife, who is clean of deed and thought,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Should not be constantly watched, certainly;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And truly the labor is in vain<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To keep a shrew, for it will not be.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This hold I for a real act of folly,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To waste labor guarding wives:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thus wrote old clerks in their time.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But now to purpose, as I first began:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This worthy Phoebus does all that he can<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To please her, supposing for such pleasing actions,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And for his manly qualities and his behavior,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That no man should have put him out of her grace.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But God knows it, there can no man embrace<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And restrain a thing which nature<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Has naturally set in a creature.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Take any bird, and put it in a cage,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And give all thy attention and take thy pains<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To foster it tenderly with food and drink<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of all dainties that thou can imagine,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And keep it as cleanly as thou can,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Although his cage of gold be never so gay,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Yet would this bird, by twenty thousand times,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Rather in a forest that is rude and cold<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Go eat worms and such wretched food.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For ever this bird will work diligently<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To escape out of his cage, if he can.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His liberty this bird desires always.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Let's take a cat, and foster him well with milk<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And tender meat, and make his couch of silk,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And let him see a mouse go by the wall,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Right then he refuses milk and meat and all,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And every dainty that is in that house,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Such appetite has he to eat a mouse.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Lo, here has lust his domination,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And appetite drives away discretion.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A she-wolf has also an evil nature.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The most crude wolf that she can find,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or least of reputation, will she take,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In time when she lusts to have a mate.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; All these examples I about speak these men<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That are untrue, and nothing about women.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For men have ever a lecherous appetite<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; On lower things to perform their delight<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Than on their wives, be they never so fair,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Nor never so true, nor so gracious.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Flesh is so fond of novelty, curses on it,    <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That we can not take pleasure in anything <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That is consonant with virtue for any length of time.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This Phoebus, who thought upon no guile,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Deceived was, despite all his attractive qualities.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For under him another had she,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A man of little reputation,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Worth nothing in comparison to Phoebus.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The more harm is, it happens often so,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of which there comes much harm and woe.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And so befell, when Phoebus was absent,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His wife immediately has for her sweetheart sent.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Her sweetheart? Certes, this is a knavish speech!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Forgive it me, and that I you beseech.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The wise Plato says, as you may read,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The word must by necessity accord with the deed.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If men shall tell a thing properly,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The word must be cousin to the deed.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I am an unlearned man, right thus say I:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There is no difference, truly,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Between a wife that is of high degree,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If of her body dishonest she bee,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And a poor wench, other than this --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If it so be they work both amiss --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Except that the gentle, higher in rank,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She shall be called his lady, as in love;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And because that other is a poor woman,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She shall be called his wench or his sweetie.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And, God it knows, my own dear brother,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Men lay that one as low as lies that other.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Right so between an usurping tyrant<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And an outlaw or an arrant thief,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The same I say: there is no difference.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To Alexander was told this sentence,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That, because the tyrant is of greater might<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; By the size of his army to slay downright,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And burn house and home, and level everything,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Lo, therefore is he called a captain;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And because the outlaw has but a small group of followers,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And can not do as much harm as he,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Nor bring a country to such great mischief,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Men call him an outlaw or a thief.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But because I am not a learned man,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I will tell nothing of texts, never a bit;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I will go to my tale, as I began.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When Phoebus wife had sent for her leman,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Right away they satisfied all their reckless lust.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The white crow, that hanged always in the cage,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Beheld their work, and said never a word.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And when home was come Phoebus, the lord,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This crow sang "Cuckoo! Cuckoo! Cuckoo!"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "What, bird?" said Phoebus. "What song singest thou?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Were thou not accustomed so merrily to sing<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That to my heart it was a rejoicing<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To hear thy voice? Alas, what song is this?"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "By God," said he, "I sing not amiss.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Phoebus," said he, "for all thy worthiness,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For all thy beauty and thy nobility,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For all thy song and all thy music,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For all thy watching, thou hast been tricked<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; By one of little reputation,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Not worth, compared to thee, <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The value of a gnat, as I may thrive!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For on thy bed I saw him copulate with thy wife."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What more do you want? The crow immediately him told,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; By clear evidence and by bold words,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; How his wife had done her lechery,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To his great shame and to his great dishonor,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And told him repeatedly he saw it with his eyes.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This Phoebus began to turn away,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And thought his sorrowful heart would break in two.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His bow he bent, and set therein an arrow,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And in his ire his wife then has he slain.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This is the substance of it; there is no more to say;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For sorrow of which he broke his musical instruments,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Both harp, and lute, and cither, and psaltery;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And also he broke his arrows and his bow,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And after that thus spoke he to the crow:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Traitor," said he, "with tongue of scorpion,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thou hast me brought to my ruin;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Alas, that I was wrought! Why was I not dead?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; O dear wife! O gem of delight!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who were to me so stable and also so true,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Now liest thou dead, with face pale of hue,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Full guiltless, that dare I swear, indeed!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; O rash hand, to do so foul a crime!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; O troubled wit, O reckless anger,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That recklessly smites the guiltless!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; O mistrust, full of false suspicion,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Where was thy wit and thy discretion?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; O every man, beware of rashness!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Do not believe any thing without strong evidence.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Smite not too soon, before you know why,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And be advised well and soberly<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Before you act in any way <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Upon your anger caused by suspicion.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Alas, a thousand folk has rash anger<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Completely undone, and brought them in the mire.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Alas! For sorrow I will myself slay!"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And to the crow, "O false thief!" said he,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "I will pay thee back immediately (for) thy false tale.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thou once sang like a nightingale;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Now shalt thou, false thief, give up thy song,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And also thy white feathers every one,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Nor never in all thy life shalt thou speak.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thus shall men on a traitor be avenged;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thou and thy offspring ever shall be black,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Nor never sweet noise shall you make,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But ever cry in anticipation of tempest and rain,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As a sign that through thee my wife is slain."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And to the crow he rushed, and that right away,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And pulled out his white feathers every one,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And made him black, and took away all his song,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And also his speech, and out the door slung him <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Unto the devil, to whom I commit him;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And because of this case all crows are black.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Gentlemen, by this example I you pray,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Beware, and take care what you say:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And tell never any man in your life<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; How another man has copulated with his wife;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He will hate you mortally, certainly.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Dan Salomon, as wise clerks say,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Teaches a man to guard his tongue well.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But, as I said, I am not learned.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But nonetheless, thus taught me my mother:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "My son, think on the crow, in God's name!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; My son, hold well thy tongue, and keep thy friend.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A wicked tongue is worse than a fiend;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; My son, from a fiend men can bless themselves.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; My son, God of his endless goodness<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Walled a tongue with teeth and lips also,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So that man should think about what he may speak.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; My son, very often, for too much speech<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Has many a man been ruined, as clerks teach,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But for little speech well considered<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Is no man harmed, to speak generally.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; My son, thy tongue thou should restrain<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; At all times, but when thou make an effort<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To speak of God, in honor and prayer.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The first virtue, son, if thou will learn,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Is to restrain and guard well thy tongue;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thus learn children when they are young.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; My son, of much ill-considered speaking,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Where less speaking had well enough sufficed,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Comes much harm; thus was me told and taught.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In much speech sin is not lacking.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Knowest thou what a rash tongue serves for?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Right as a sword cuts and carves<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; An arm in two, my dear son, just so<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A tongue cuts friendship all in two.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A tale-teller is to God abominable.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Read Salomon, so wise and honorable;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Read David in his psalms; read Seneca.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; My son, speak not, but with thy head thou nod.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Act as if thou were deaf, if thou hear<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A tale-teller speak of perilous matter.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Fleming says, and learn it if thou please,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That little tale-telling causes much rest.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; My son, if thou no wicked word hast said,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thou need not dread to be betrayed;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But he who has spoken evil, I dare well say,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He can by no way call his word back.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thing that is said is said, and forth it goes,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Though he repent, or be ever so unwilling (it be known).<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He is his slave to whom he has said<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A tale of which he is now very sorry.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; My son, beware, and be no author new<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of tidings, whether they be false or true.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Wherever thou come, amongst high or low,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Hold well thy tongue and think upon the crow."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I suppose men would consider it negligence<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;If I forget to tell the expenditure<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Of Theseus, who goes (about) so busily<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To build the lists royally,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That such a noble theatre as it was<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I dare well say there was not (another such) in this world.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The circumference was a mile around,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Walled with stone, and surrounded by a ditch.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Round was the shape, in the manner of a circle,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Full of tiers of seats, the height of sixty paces,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That when a man was set on one tier of seats,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He did not hinder his fellow from seeing.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Eastward there stood a gate of white marble,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Westward just such another on the opposite (side).<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And shortly to conclude, such a place<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Was none in earth, (constructed) in so little time;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For in the land there was no skilled man<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Who knows geometry or arithmetic,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nor painter, nor carver of images,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That Theseus did not give him food and wages<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To make and devise the theatre.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And to do his rite and sacrifice,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He has eastward, upon the gate above,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In worship of Venus, goddess of love,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Had made an altar and a chapel;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And on the westward gate, in memory<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Of Mars, he has made just such another,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That cost fully a cartload of gold.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And northward, in a turret on the wall,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Of white alabaster and red coral,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A chapel, rich to look upon,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In worship of Diana of chastity,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Has Theseus had made in noble style.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But yet had I forgotten to describe<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The noble sculpture and the portraits,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The shape, the appearance, and the figures<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That were in these three chapels.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;First in the temple of Venus canst thou see<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Wrought on the wall, full piteous to behold,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The broken sleeps, and the cold sighs,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The sacred tears, and the lamenting,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The fiery strokes of the desiring<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That love's servants endure in this life;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The oaths that assure their covenants;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Pleasure and Hope, Desire, Foolhardiness,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Beauty and Youth, Mirth, Riches,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Charms and Force, Lies, Flattery,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Expenditures, Attentiveness, and Jealousy,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Who wore a garland of yellow marigolds,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And a cuckoo sitting on her hand;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Feasts, musical instruments, dance-songs, dances,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Desire and festivity, and all the details<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Of love, which I recounted and shall recount,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Were painted in sequence on the wall,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And more than I can make mention of.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For truly all the mount of Cithaeron,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Where Venus has her principal dwelling,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Was shown on the wall in portraits,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With all the garden (of Love) and the pleasure.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The porter, Idleness, was not forgotten <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nor the handsome Narcissus of many years ago,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nor yet the folly of king Solomon,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nor yet the great strength of Hercules --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The enchantments of Medea and Circes --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nor of Turnus, with the hardy fierce courage,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The riche Cresus, wretched in servitude.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Thus can you see that wisdom nor riches,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Beauty nor trickery, strength nor bravery,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Can not share power with Venus,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For she may rule the world as she pleases.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Lo, all these folk were so caught in her snare,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Until for woe they very often said "alas!"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;One or two examples here suffice,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Even though I could recount a thousand more.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The statue of Venus, glorious to look upon,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Was naked, floating in the large sea,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And from the navel down all was covered <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With waves green and bright as any glass.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She had a citole (zither-like instrument) in her right hand,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And on her head, very elegant to look upon,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A rose garland, fresh and fragrant;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Above her head her doves fluttering.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Before her stood her son Cupid;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He had two wings upon his shoulders,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And he was blind, as it is often seen;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He carried a bow and arrows bright and keen.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Why should I not as well also tell you all<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The portraiture that was upon the wall<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Within the temple of mighty Mars the red?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;All painted was the wall, in length and breadth,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Like to the interior of the grisly place<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That is called the Great Temple of Mars in Thrace,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In that same cold, frosty region<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Where Mars has his most excellent mansion.  <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;First a forest was painted on the wall,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In which there dwells neither man nor beast,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With knotty, gnarled, barren old trees,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of stumps sharp and hideous to behold,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Through which there ran a rumbling in a moaning of wind,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	As though a storm should burst every bough.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	And downward from a hill, close to a grassy slope,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	There stood the temple of Mars, powerful in arms,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Wrought all of burnished steel, of which the entry<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Was long and narrow, and frightening to look upon.  <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And out of there came a rush of wind and such a blast<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That it made all the gate to shake.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The northern light shone in at the doors,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For there was no window on the wall,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Through which men might discern any light.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The door was all of eternal adamant (hardest of stones),<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Bound crosswise and lengthwise <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With tough iron; and to make it strong,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Every pillar, to support the temple,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Was big as a large barrel, (made) of iron bright and shining.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There I saw first the malicious plotting<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Of Felony, and all the scheming;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The cruel Anger, red as any glowing coal;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The pick-purse, and also the pale Fear;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The smiler with the knife under the cloak;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The stable burning with the black smoke;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The treason of the murdering in the bed;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The open war, all covered with blood from wounds:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Strife, with bloody knife and sharp menacing.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;All full of creaking was that sorry place.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There yet I saw slayer of himself there --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;His heart-blood has bathed all his hair --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The nail driven in the top of the head at night;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The cold death, with mouth gaping upwards.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Amidst the temple sat Misfortune,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With grief and sorry countenance.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Yet I saw Madness, laughing in his rage,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Armed Discontent, Alarm, and fierce Violence;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The corpse in the woods, with (its) throat cut;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A thousand slain, and not killed by the plague;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The tyrant, with his prey taken by force;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The town destroyed, there was nothing left.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Yet I saw burned the ships dancing (on the waves);<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The hunter killed by the wild bears;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The sow devouring the child right in the cradle;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The cook scalded, despite his long-handled spoon.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nothing concerning the evil influence of Mars was forgotten.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The wagon driver run over by his wagon --   <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He lay down full low under the wheel.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There were also, of those influenced by Mars,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The barber, and the butcher, and the smith,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Who forges sharp swords on his anvil.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And all above, painted in a tower,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I saw conquest, sitting in great honor,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With the sharp sword over his head<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Hanging by a thin thread of twine.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Depicted was the slaughter of Julius,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Of great Nero, and of Antonius;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Although at that same time they were unborn,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Yet was their death depicted before then<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;By menacing of Mars, according to the horoscope;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So was it shown in that portraiture,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As is depicted in the stars above<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Who shall be slain or else dead for love.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Suffices one illustrative tale in old histories; <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I can not recount them all even if I desired to.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The statue of Mars stood upon a chariot<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Armed, and looked as grim as if he were mad;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And over his head there shine two figures<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Of stars, that are called in books,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That one Puella, that other Rubeus --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This god of arms was arrayed thus.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A wolf stood there before him at his feet<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With red eyes, and he ate of a man;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With subtle brush was depicted this story<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In reverence of Mars and of his glory.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Now to the temple of Diana the chaste,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As briefly as I can, I will hasten myself,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To tell you all the description.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The walls are painted all over<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(With scenes) of hunting and of modest chastity.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There I saw how woeful Callisto,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When Diana was angry with her,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Was turned from a woman into a bear,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And after she was made the North Star<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Thus was it painted; I can tell you no more.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Her son is also a star, as one can see.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There I saw Daphne, turned into a tree --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I mean not the goddess Diana,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But Penneus' daughter, who is called Daphne.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There I saw Actaeon changed into a hart,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For vengeance that he saw Diana all naked;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I saw how his hounds have caught him <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And devoured him, because they did not know him.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Yet was painted a little further on <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;How Atalanta hunted the wild boar,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And Meleager, and many more others,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For which Diana wrought him care and woe.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There I saw many another wonderful story,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The which I do not desire to call to mind.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This goddess sat full high on a hart,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With small hounds all about her feet,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And underneath her feet she had a moon --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Waxing it was and should wane soon.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Her statue was clothed in yellowish green,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With bow in hand and arrows in a quiver.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She cast her eyes down full low <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Where Pluto has his dark region.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A woman in childbirth was before her;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But because her child was so long unborn,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Very piteously did she call on Lucina <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And said, "Help, for thou canst (do so) best of all!"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He who made it well knew how to paint in a life-like manner;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With many a florin he bought the paints.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Now these lists are made, and Theseus,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Who at his great cost thus prepared<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The temples and the theatre in all respects,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When it was done, it greatly pleased him.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But I will stop speaking of Theseus a little while,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And speak of Palamon and of Arcite.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The day of their return approaches,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When each one should bring a hundred knights<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To decide the battle, as I told you.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And to Athens, to keep their agreement,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Each one of them has brought a hundred knights,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Well armed for the battle in all respects.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And surely many a man there believed<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That never, since the world began,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To speak of knighthood of (the deeds of) their hand,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As far as God has made sea or land,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Was not of so few so noble a company.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For every person that loved chivalry<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And would, willingly, have an outstanding reputation<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Has prayed that he might participate in that game;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And well it was for him who was chosen to be there,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For if there fell tomorrow such a situation,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;You know well that every vigorous  knight<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Who loves passionately and has his might,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Were it in England or elsewhere,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;They would, willingly, desire to be there --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To fight for a lady, bless me! <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It would be a pleasing sight to see.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And right so fared those with Palamon.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With him there went knights many a one;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;One of them will be armed in a coat of mail,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And in a breastplate and a light tunic;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And one of them will have a set of plate armor;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And one of them will have a Prussian shield or a buckler;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;One of them will be well armed on his legs,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And have an axe, and one a mace of steel --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There is no new fashion that has not been old.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;They were armed, as I have told you,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Every one according to his preference.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There mayst thou seen, coming with Palamon,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Lycurgus himself, the great king of Thrace.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Black was his beard, and manly was his face;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The circles of his eyes in his head,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;They glowed between yellow and red,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And he looked about like a griffin (with an eagle's head),<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With shaggy hairs on his stout brows;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;His limbs large, his muscles hard and strong,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;His shoulders broad, his arms round and long;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And as was the fashion in his country,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He stood full high upon a chariot of gold,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With four white bulls in the traces.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Instead of a tunic with his coat of arms over his armor,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With claws yellow and bright as any gold, <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He had a bear's skin, coal-black because of age.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;His long hair was combed behind his back;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Like any raven's feather it shone because of its blackness;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A wreath of gold, thick as an arm, of huge weight,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Upon his head, set full of bright stones,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Of fine rubies and of diamonds.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;About his chariot there went white wolfhounds,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Twenty and more, as big as any steer,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To hunt for the lion or the deer,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And followed him with muzzles securely bound,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Wearing collars of gold, and rings for leashes filed round.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He had a hundred lords in his company,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Very well armed, with stern and stout hearts.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With Arcite, as people find in histories,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The great Emetreus, the king of India,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Upon a reddish-brown steed with trappings of steel,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Covered in cloth of gold, well decorated  (with geometric patterns),<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Came riding like the god of arms, Mars.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;His tunic with his coat of arms was of cloth of Tarsia (in Turkestan)<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Adorned with pearls white and round and big;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;His saddle was newly adorned with pure gold;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A short cloak hanging upon his shoulder,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Brimful of rubies red as sparkling fire;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;His curly hair like rings was run (fashioned),<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And that was yellow, and glittered like the sun.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;His nose was high, his eyes bright lemon yellow,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;His lips round, his color was ruddy;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A few freckles were sprinkled in his face,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Between yellow and somewhat mingled with black;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And as a lion he cast about his look.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I reckon his age at five and twenty years.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;His beard had well begun to spring;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;His voice was like a trumpet thundering.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Upon his head he wore of green laurel <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A garland, fresh and pleasing to look upon.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Upon his hand he carried for his delight<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A tame eagle, white as any lily.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He had a hundred lords with him there,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;All armed, except for their heads, in all their equipment,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Very richly in every detail.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For trust well that dukes, earls, kings<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Were gathered in this noble company,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For love and for the benefit of chivalry.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;About this king there ran on all sides  <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Full many a tame lion and leopard.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And in this manner these lords, one and all,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Are come to the city on the Sunday <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;About nine a.m., and in the town dismounted.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This Theseus, this duke, this worthy knight,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When he had brought them into his city,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And provided them lodging, each one according to his rank,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He feasts them, and does such great labor<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To entertain them and do them all honor<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That people still believe that the wit of no man<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Of any rank could do better.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The music, the service at the feast,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The great gifts to every one,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The rich adornment of Theseus' palace,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nor who sat first nor last upon the dais,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;What ladies are fairest or best in dancing,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Or which of them can dance best and sing,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nor who speaks most feelingly of love;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;What hawks sit on the perch above,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;What hounds lie down on the floor --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I now make no mention of all this,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But (speak only) of the substance; that seems to me the best.		<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Now comes the point, and listen if you please.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Sunday night, before day began to spring,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When Palamon heard the lark sing<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(Although it was not day by two hours,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Yet sang the lark) and Palamon right then<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With pious heart and with a noble disposition,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He rose to go on his pilgrimage<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To the blessed gracious Citherea --	<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I mean Venus, honorable and worshipful.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And in her (planetary) hour he walks forth slowly<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Unto the lists where her temple was,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And down he kneels, and with humble expression<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And painful heart he said as you shall hear:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Fairest of the fair, O lady mine, Venus,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Daughter to Jove and spouse of Vulcan,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Thou maker of joy of the mount of Citheron,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For that same love thou haddest to Adonis,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Have pity on my bitter, smarting tears,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And take my humble prayer to thy heart.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Alas! I do not have any language to tell<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The effects nor the torments of my hell;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;My heart can not reveal my harms;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I am so befuddled that I can not say (anything)<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But `Mercy, lady bright, who knowest well<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;My thought and seest what harms I feel!'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Consider all this and have pity upon my pain,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As surely as I shall for evermore,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;According to my power (as much as I can), be thy true servant,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And make war always against chastity.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I make that my vow, providing you help me!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I care not to boast of arms <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nor do I ask to have victory tomorrow,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nor renown in this case, nor vain glory<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nor fame for deeds of arms proclaimed everywhere;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But I would have fully possession<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Of Emelye, and die in thy service.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Find thou the manner how and in what way:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I care not if it may better be<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To have victory over them, or they over me,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So that I have my lady in my arms.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For though it be true that Mars is god of arms,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Your power is so great in heaven above<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That if you please, I shall well have my love.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I will worship thy temple evermore,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And on thy altar, whether I ride or walk (whatever I do),<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I will do sacrifice and kindle fires.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And if you will not (do) so, my lady sweet,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Then I pray thee, tomorrow with a spear<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That Arcite stab me through the heart.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Then I care not, when I have lost my life,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Though Arcite win her to be his wife.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This is the substance and goal of my prayer:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Give me my love, thou blessed dear lady."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When the prayer of Palamon was done,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He did his sacrifice, and that quickly,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Full piteously, with all due ceremony,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Although I tell not now his observances;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But at the last the statue of Venus shook,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And made a sign, whereby he understood<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That his prayer was accepted that day.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For though the sign showed a delay,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Yet he knew well that his request was granted,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And with glad heart he went home very soon.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The third planetary hour after Palamon<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Began to go to Venus' temple,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Up rose the sun, and up rose Emelye<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And to the temple of Diana did hasten.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Her maidens, whom she led thither with her,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;They had the fire full readily with them,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The incense, the cloths, and all the rest<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That is needed for the sacrifice;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The horns full of mead, as was the custom --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There lacked nothing (needed) to do her sacrifice.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The temple smoking (with incense), full of fair cloths,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This Emelye, with gentle heart,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Washed her body with water of a well.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But how she did her rite I dare not tell,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Unless it be some thing in general; <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And yet it would be a pleasure to hear all.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To one who means well it would be no matter of concern;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But it is good for a man to be without restriction (speak freely).<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Her bright hair was combed, all loose;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A crown of an evergreen oak <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Was set upon her head full fair and suitable.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Two fires on the altar did she kindle,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And did her duties, as men can behold<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In Statius' <i>Thebaid</i> and such old books.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When the fire was kindled, with a pitiful expression<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Unto Diana she spoke as you may hear:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"O chaste goddess of the green woods,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To whom both heaven and earth and sea is visible,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Queen of the dark and low reign of Pluto,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Goddess of maidens, whom my heart hast known<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Full many a year, and knowest what I desire,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Keep me from thy vengeance and thy ire,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Which Acteon paid for cruelly.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Chaste goddess, well knowest thou that I<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Desire to be a maiden all my life,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nor never will I be no lover nor wife.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I am, thou knowest, yet of thy company,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A maiden, and love hunting and the chase,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And to walk in the wild woods,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And not to be a wife and be with child.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I do not desire to know company of man.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Now help me, lady, since you can and know how,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For those three forms that thou hast in thee.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And Palamon, that has such love to me,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And also Arcite, who loves me so painfully,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This grace I pray thee and ask no more,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Send love and peace between them two,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And turn away their hearts from me so<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That all their hot love and their desire,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And all their intense torment, and their fire<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Will be quenched, or turned to another place.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And if it so be thou wilt not do me grace,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Or if my destiny is shaped so<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That I must by necessity have one of them two,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Send me him who most desires me.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Behold, goddess of clean chastity,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The bitter tears that fall on my cheeks.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Since thou art maiden and guardian of us all,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Thou care for and well conserve my maidenhood,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And while I live, as a maiden I will serve thee."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The fires burn brightly upon the altar,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;While Emelye was thus in her prayer.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But suddenly she saw a curious sight,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For right away one of the fires quenched<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And rekindled again, and after that straightway<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That other fire was quenched and all gone;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And as it quenched it made a roaring sound,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As these wet brands do in their burning,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And at the brand's end (the fire) ran out straightway<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As if it were many bloody drops;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For which so sorely frightened was Emelye<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That she was well nigh mad and began to cry,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For she did not know what it signified,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But simply for fear has she cried thus,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And wept that it was a pity to hear.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And right then Diana did appear,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With bow in hand, just like a huntress,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And said, "Daughter, cease thy sadness.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Among the high gods it is affirmed,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And by eternal word written and confirmed,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Thou shalt be wedded unto one of those<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Who have for thee so much care and woe,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But unto which of them I may not tell.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Farwell, for I can stay no longer .<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The fires which burn on my altar <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Shall declare to thee, before thou go hence,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Thy destiny concerning love, as in this situation."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And with that word, the arrows in the quiver<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Of the goddess clatter fast and ring,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And forth she went and vanished;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For which this Emelye was astonished,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And said, "What does this mean, alas?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I put me in thy protection,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Diana, and in thy power."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And home she goes at once the nearest way.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This is the substance; there is no more to say.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The next (planetary) hour of Mars following this,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Arcite has walked unto the temple <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Of fierce Mars to do his sacrifice,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With all the rites of his pagan manner (of worship).<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With sorrowful heart and intense devotion,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Right thus to Mars he said his prayer:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"O strong god, who in the cold reigns <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Of Thrace art honored and considered lord,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And hast in every reign and every land<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;All the control of arms in thy hand,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And grants them fortune as it pleases thee to command.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Accept of me my sorrowful sacrifice.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;If it so be that my youth may deserve,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And that my power be worthy to serve<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Thy godhead, so that I may be one of thine,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Then pray I thee to have pity upon my pain.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For that same pain and that same hot fire<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In which thou once burned for desire,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When that thou enjoyed the beauty<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Of fair, young, fresh Venus the noble,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And haddest her in arms as you wished --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Although once things went wrong for you,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When Vulcan had caught thee in his snare<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And found thee lying by his wife, alas! --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For that same sorrow that was in thy heart,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Have pity as well upon my painful sufferings. <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I am young and ignorant, as thou knowest,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And, as I suppose, injured most by love <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Than ever was any living creature,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For she that causes me to endure all this woe <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nor cares never whether I sink or swim.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And well I know, before she may promise me mercy,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I must win her with strength in the lists,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And well I know, without help or grace<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Of thee my strength can not avail.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Then help me, lord, tomorrow in my battle,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For that same fire that once burned thee,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As well as that same fire now burns me,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And bring it about so that I have victory tomorrow.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mine be the labor, and thine be the glory!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I will most honor thy most excellent temple<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Over any place, and always most labor<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In thy pleasure and in thy strong crafts,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And in thy temple I will hang my banner <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And all the arms of my company,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And evermore, until that day I die,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Eternal fire I will provide before thee (on your altar).<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And also I will bind myself to this vow:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;My beard, my hair, that hangs long down,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That never yet felt injury<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Of razor nor of shears, I will give thee,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And be thy true servant while I live.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Now, lord, have pity upon my painful sorrows;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Give me victory; I ask of thee no more."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The prayer of Arcite the strong stopped,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The rings that hung on the temple door,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And also the doors, clattered very fast,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Of which Arcite was somewhat afraid.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The fires upon the altar burned (so) brightly <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That it began to illuminate all the temple;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A sweet smell the ground at once yielded up,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And Arcite immediately raised up his hand,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And he cast more incense into the fire,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With more other rites; and at the last<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The statue of Mars began to ring its coat of mail,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And with that sound he heard a murmuring<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Very low and faint, that said thus, "Victory!"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For which he (Arcite) gave to Mars honor and glory.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And thus with joy and hope to fare well<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Arcite at once is gone unto his lodging,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As happy as a fowl is for the bright sun.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And right away such strife there is begun,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Because of that same grant, in the heaven above, <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Between Venus, the goddess of love,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And Mars, the stern god powerful in arms,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That Jupiter was hard put to stop it,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Until the pale Saturn the hostile,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Who knew so many of old adventures,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Found in his old experience a plan<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That he full soon has pleased every side.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As is truly said, old age has a great advantage;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In old age is both wisdom and experience;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;One can outrun the old but not outwit them.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Saturn anon, to stop strife and fear,  <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Although it is against his natural disposition,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He found a remedy for all this strife.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"My dear daughter Venus," said Saturn,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"My orbit, that has so wide (a course) to turn,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Has more power than any man knows.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mine is the drowning in the sea so dark;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mine is the imprisonment in the dark cell;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mine is the killing and hanging by the throat,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The murmur (of discontent) and the churls' rebelling,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The grumbling, and the secret poisoning;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I exact vengeance and do full punishment,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;While I dwell in the (zodiacal) sign of the lion.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mine is the ruin of the high halls,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The falling of the towers and of the walls<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Upon the miner or the carpenter.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I slew Sampson, shaking the pillar;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And mine are the cold maladies,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The dark treasons, and the old plots;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;My (astrological) aspect is the father of pestilence.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Now weep no more; I shall do my diligence<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So that Palamon, who is thine own knight,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Shall have his lady, as thou hast promised him.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Though Mars shall help his knight, yet nonetheless<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Between you there must be peace sometime,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Although you are not of one (the same) temperament,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Which daily causes such dissension.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I am thy grandfather, ready (to do) as you wish;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Weep now no more; I will fulfill thy desire."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Now I will stop (speaking) of the gods above,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Of Mars, and of Venus, goddess of love,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And tell you as plainly as I can<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The essential part, for which I began.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Once, as old histories tell us,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There was a duke who was called Theseus;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He was lord and governor of Athens,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And in his time such a conqueror<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That there was no one greater under the sun.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Very many a powerful country had he won;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;What with his wisdom and his chivalry,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He conquered all the land of the Amazons,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That once was called Scithia,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And wedded the queen Ypolita,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And brought her home with him into his country<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With much glory and great ceremony,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And also her young sister Emelye.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And thus with victory and with festivity<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I leave this noble duke riding to Athens,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And all his host in arms beside him.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And certainly, if it were not too long to hear,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I would have told you fully the manner<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;How the reign of Femenye was won<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;By Theseus and by his chivalry;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And of the great battle at that time<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Between Athenians and Amazons;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And how Ypolita was besieged,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The fair, bold queen of Scithia;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And of the festivity that was at their wedding,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And of the storm at her home-coming;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But all that matter I must now forgo. <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I have, God knows, a large field to till,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And the oxen in my plow are weak.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The remnant of the tale is long enough.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Also I will not hinder any one of this company;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Let every fellow tell his tale in turn,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And let's see now who shall win the supper;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And where I left off, I will again begin.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This duke, of whom I make mention,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When he was come almost unto the town,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In all his prosperity and in his most pride,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He was aware, as he cast his eye aside,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Where there kneeled in the high way<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A company of ladies, two by two,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Each after another, clad in black clothes;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But such a cry and such a woeful (lament) they make<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That in this world is no living creature <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That (ever) heard lamentation such as this;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And of this cry they would not ever stop<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Until they seized the reins of his bridle.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"What folk are you, who at my homecoming<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So disturb my festival with crying?"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Said Theseus. "Have you such great envy<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Of my honor, (you) who thus lament and cry?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Or who has injured or offended you?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And tell me if it may be remedied,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And why you are clothed thus in black."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The eldest lady of them all spoke,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;After she had swooned with (so) deadly a countenance,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That it was pitiful to see and hear;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She said, "Lord, to whom Fortune has given<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Victory, and (allowed) to live as a conqueror,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Your glory and your honor does not grieve us,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But we beseech (you for) mercy and succor.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Have mercy on our woe and our distress!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Some drop of pity, because of thy nobility,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Let thou fall upon us wretched women,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For, certainly, lord, there is not one of us all<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Who has not been a duchesse or a queen.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Now we are miserable wretches, as it is easily seen,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Thanks be to Fortune and her false wheel,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Who assures no estate (will continue) to be well.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And certainly, lord, to await your presence,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Here in this temple of the goddess Clemency<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We have been waiting all this fortnight.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Now help us, lord, since it is in thy power.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I, wretch, who weep and wail thus,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Was once wife to king Cappaneus,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Who died at Thebes -- cursed be that day! --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And all of us who are in this condition<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And make all this lamentation,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We lost all our husbands at that town,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;While the siege lay around it.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And yet now the old Creon -- woe oh woe! --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Who is now lord of the city of Thebes,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Filled with anger and with iniquity,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He, for spite and for his tyranny,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To do dishonor to the dead bodies<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Of all our lords who are slain,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Has dragged all the bodies in a heap,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And will not allow them, not at all, <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Neither to be buried nor burned,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But makes hounds eat them as an insult."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And with that word, without more delay,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;They fell face down and cried piteously,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Have some mercy on us wretched women,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And let our sorrow sink in thy heart."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This gentle duke leaped down from his war horse<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With compassionate heart, when he heard them speak.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It seemed to him that his heart would break,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When he saw them so pitiful and so dejected,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That once were of such high rank;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And in his arms he caught up them all,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And comforts them with very good will,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And swore his oath, as he was true knight,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(That) he would do his might so completely<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To avenge them upon the tyrant Creon <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That all the people of Greece should speak (about)<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;How Creon was treated by Theseus<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As one who had very well deserved his death.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And right away, without more delay,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He displays his banner, and rode forth <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Toward Thebes, and all his army beside (him).<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He would not walk nor ride any nearer to Athens,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nor take his ease fully half a day,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But that night he lay (camped) on his way,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And sent straightway Ypolita the queen,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And Emelye, her beautiful young sister,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Unto the town of Athens to dwell,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And forth he rides; there is no more to tell.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The red statue of Mars, with spear and shield,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So shines in his large white banner<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That all the fields glitter all around;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And by his banner is carried his pennon<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Of very rich gold, in which there was embroidered<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Minotaur, which he defeated in Crete.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Thus rides this duke, thus rides this conqueror,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And in his army the flower of chivalry,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Until he came to Thebes and dismounted<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Graciously in a field, where he intended to fight.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But briefly to speak of this thing,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With Creon, who was king of Thebes,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He fought, and slew him boldly as a knight<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In open battle, and put the army to flight;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And by assault he won the city afterwards,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And tore down both wall and beam and rafter;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And he gave back to the ladies <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The bones of their husbands who were slain,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To do obsequies, as was then the custom.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But it would be all too long to describe <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The great clamor and the lamentation<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That the ladies made at the burning<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Of the bodies, and the great honor<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That Theseus, the noble conqueror,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Does to the ladies, when they went from him;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But briefly to tell is my intent.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When this worthy duke, this Theseus,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Has slain Creon and thus won Thebes,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Still in that field he took all night his rest,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And did with all the country as he pleased.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To search in the heap of dead bodies,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To strip them of armor and of clothing,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The scavengers took great pains and worked hard<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;After the battle and defeat.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And (it) so befell that in the heap they found,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Pierced through with many a grievous bloody wound,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Two young knights lying side by side,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Both with the same coat of arms, very richly wrought,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Of which two one was called Arcite,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And that other knight was called Palamon.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;They were not fully alive, nor fully dead,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But by their coats of arms and by their equipment<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The heralds best knew them in particular<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As they that were of the royal blood <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Of Thebes, and born of two sisters.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The scavengers have pulled them out of the heap,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And have carried them softy unto the tent<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Of Theseus; and he very soon sent them <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To Athens, to dwell in prison<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Perpetually -- he would not (accept) any ransom.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And when this worthy duke has thus done,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He took his army, and home he rides straightway<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As a conqueror crowned with laurel;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And there he lives in joy and in honor<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For the duration of his life; what more words are needed?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And in a tower, in anguish and in woe,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This Palamon and his fellow Arcite<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For evermore (remain); no gold can ransom them.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This passes year by year and day by day,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Until it befell once, in a morning of May,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That Emelye, who was fairer to be seen <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Than is the lily upon its green stalk,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And fresher than the May with new flowers --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For her hue vied with color of the rose,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I do not know which was the finer of them two --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Before it was day, as was her custom to do,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She was arisen and all ready prepared,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For May will have no laziness at night.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The season urges on every gentle heart,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And makes it out of its sleep to awake suddenly,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And says "Arise, and do thy observance."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This made Emelye remember<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To do honor to May, and to rise.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She was gaily clothed, so to say:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Her yellow hair was braided in a tress<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Behind her back, a yard long, I guess.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And in the garden, at the rising of the sun,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She walks up and down, and as she pleases<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She gathers flowers, mixed white and red,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To make an intricate garland for her head;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And she sang (as) heavenly as an angel.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The great tower, that was so thick and strong,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Which was the main fortification of the castle<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(Where the knights were in prison<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Of which I told yow and shall tell),<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Was just next to the garden wall<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Where this Emelye took her pleasure.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The sun was bright and clear that morning,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And Palamon, this woeful prisoner,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As was his custom, by permission of his jailer,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Had risen and roamed in a chamber on high,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In which he saw all the noble city,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And also the garden, full of green branches,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Where this fresh Emelye the bright<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Was in her walk, and roamed up and down.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This sorrowful prisoner, this Palamon,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Goes in the chamber roaming to and fro<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And to himself lamenting his woe.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That he was born, full often he said, "alas!"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And so it happened, by chance or accident,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That through a window, thickly set with many a bar<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Of iron, great and square as any beam,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He cast his eye upon Emelye,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And with that he turned pale and cried, "A!"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As though he were stabbed unto the heart.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And with that cry Arcite immediately leaped up <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And said, "My cousin, what ails thee,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Who art so pale and deadly to look upon?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Why didst thou cry out? Who has done thee offence?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For the love of God, take all in patience<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Our imprisonment, for it may not be otherwise.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Fortune has given us this adversity.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Some wicked aspect or disposition<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Of Saturn, by some arrangement of the heavenly bodies,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Has given us this, although we had sworn it would not be;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So stood the heavens when we were born.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We must endure it; this is the short and plain."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This Palamon answered and said in reply,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Cousin, truly, concerning this opinion<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Thou hast a foolish conception.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This prison did not cause me to cry out,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But I was hurt right now through my eye<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Into my heart, so that it will be the death of me.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The fairness of that lady whom I see<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Yonder in the garden roaming to and fro<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Is cause of all my crying and my woe.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I know not whether she is woman or goddess,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But truly it is Venus, as I suppose."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And with that he fell down on his knees,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And said, "Venus, if it be thy will<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Thus to transfigure yourself in this garden <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Before me, sorrowful, wretched creature,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Help that we may escape out of this prison.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And if it be so that my destiny is shaped<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;By eternal decree to die in prison,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Have some compassion on our (noble) lineage<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Which is brought so low by tyranny."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And with that word Arcite did see<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Where this lady roamed to and fro,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And with that sight her beauty hurt him so,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That, if Palamon was sorely wounded,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Arcite is hurt as much as he, or more.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And with a sigh he said piteously,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"The fresh beauty slays me suddenly<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Of her who roams in the yonder place;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And unless I have her mercy and her grace,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So that I can at least see her, <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I am as good as dead; there is no more to say."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This Palamon, when he heard those words,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Angrily he looked and answered,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Sayest thou this in earnest or in play?"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Nay," said Arcite, "in earnest, by my faith!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So help me God, I have no desire to play."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This Palamon did knit his two brows.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"It would not be," said he, "any great honor to thee <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To be false, nor to be traitor<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To me, who am thy cousin and thy brother<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Sworn very sincerely, and each of us to the other,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That never, though we had to die by torture,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Until death shall part us two,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Neither of us in love (is) to hinder the other,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nor in any other case, my dear brother,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But rather thou shouldest truly help me<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In every case, as I shall help thee --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This was thy oath, and mine also, certainly;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I know right well, thou darest not deny it.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Thus thou art my trusted confidant, without doubt,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And now thou wouldest falsely be busy preparing <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To love my lady, whom I love and serve,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And ever shall until my heart dies.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nay, certainly, false Arcite, thou shalt not (do) so.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I loved hire first, and told thee my woe<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As to my confidant and my sworn brother <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To further me, as I have told before.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For which thou art bound as a knight<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To help me, if it lay in thy power,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Or else thou art false, I dare well say."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This Arcite full proudly spoke in return:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Thou shalt," said he, "be rather false than I;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And thou art false, I tell thee flatly,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As a mistress I loved her first before thou.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;What wilt thou say? Thou knowest not yet now<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Whether she is a woman or goddess!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Thine is a feeling of holiness,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And mine is love as to a creature;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For which I told thee my circumstance<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As to my cousin and my sworn brother.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I posit (this assumption): that thou lovedest her first;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Knowest thou not well the old clerks' saying,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That `who shall give a lover any law?'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Love is a greater law, by my skull,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Than may be given to any earthly man;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And therefore positive (man-made) law and such decree<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Is broken every day for love in every way.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A man must of necessity love, in spite of all he can do;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He can not flee (from) it, though he should be dead,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Whether she be maid, or widow, or else wife.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And also it is not likely all thy life<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To stand in her good graces; no more shall I;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For well thou thyself knowest, truly,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That thou and I are condemned to prison<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Perpetually; no ransom can help us.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We strive as the hounds did for the bone;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;They fought all day, and yet their share was nothing.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There came a kite, while they were so angry,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And carried away the bone between them both.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And therefore, at the king's court, my brother,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Each man for himself, there is no other (way).<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Love, if it please thee, for I love and always shall;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And truly, dear brother, this is all.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Here in this prison we must endure,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And each one of us take his chance."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Great and long was the strife between them two,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;If I had leisure to tell (it);<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But to the point. It happened on a day,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To tell it to you as briefly as I can,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A worthy duke that was called  Perotheus,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Who was  a friend to duke Theseus<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Since that same time that they were little children,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Had come to Athens to visit his friend,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And to amuse himself as he was accustomed to do;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For in this world he loved no man so (much),<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And he (Theseus) loved him as tenderly in turn.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So well they loved, as old books say,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That when one was dead, truly to tell,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;His friend went and sought him down in hell --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But of that story I do not desire to write.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Duke Perotheus loved well Arcite,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And had known him at Thebes year after year,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And finally at request and prayer<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Of Perotheus, without any ransom,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Duke Theseus let him out of prison<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Freely to go all over, wherever he wishes,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In such a manner as shall I tell you.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This was the agreement, plainly to write,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Between Theseus and this Arcite:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That if it so were that Arcite were found<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ever in his life, by day or night, at any moment<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In any country of this Theseus,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And if he were caught, it was agreed thus,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That with a sword he should lose his head.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There was no other remedy nor course of action;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But (he) takes his leave, and homeward he sped.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Let him be ware! His neck lies as a pledge.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;How great a sorrow now suffers Arcite!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He feels the death smite through his heart;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He weeps, wails, cries piteously;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To slay himself he secretly awaits (an opportunity).<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He said, "Alas that day that I was born!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Now my prison is worse than before;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Now I am destined eternally to dwell<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Not in purgatory, but in hell.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Alas, that ever I knew Perotheus!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For else I would have remained with Theseus,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Fettered in his prison evermore.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Then would I have been in bliss and not in woe.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Only the sight of her whom I serve,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Though I never can deserve her grace,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Would have sufficed right enough for me.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;O dear cousin Palamon," said he,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"The victory of this adventure is thine.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Very blissfully in prison thou can remain --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In prison? Certainly not, but in paradise!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Well has Fortune turned the dice for thee,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That hast the sight of her, and I the absence.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For it is possible, since thou hast her presence,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And art a knight, a worthy and an able (one),<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That by some chance, since Fortune is changeable,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Thou mayest sometime attain thy desire.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But I, who am exiled and barren<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Of all grace, and in so great despair<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That there is not earth, water, fire, nor air,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nor creature that is made of them,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That can help me or do comfort (to me) in this,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Well ought I to die in despair and distress.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Farwell my life, my desire, and my gladness!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Alas, why do folk so commonly complain <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;About the providence of God, or of Fortune,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That gives them full often in many a manner<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Much better than they can themselves imagine?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;One man desires to have riches,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Which is the cause of his murder or great sickness;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And one man would happily (go) out of his prison,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Who is slain in his house by members of his household.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Infinite harms are in this matter.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We know not what thing we pray for here;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We act like one who is drunk as a mouse.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A drunk man knows well he has a house,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But he does not know which is the right way to it,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And to a drunk man the way is slippery.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And certainly, so we fare in this world;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We seek eagerly after felicity,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But we go wrong very often, truly.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Thus can we all say, and especially I,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Who supposed and had a firm belief<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That if I might escape from prison,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Then I would have been in joy and perfect well-being,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Whereas now I am exiled from my source of happiness.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Since I can not see you, Emelye,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I am as good as dead; there is not any remedy."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Upon that other side Palamon,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When he knew Arcite was gone,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He makes such sorrow that the great tour<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Resounds with his yowling and clamor.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The great fetters themselves on his shins <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Were wet from his bitter, salt tears.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Alas," said he, "Arcite, cousin mine,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Of all our strife, God knows, the profit is thine.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Thou walkest freely now in Thebes,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And thou care little about my woe.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Thou mayest, since thou hast wisdom and manhood,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Assemble all the folk of our family,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And make a war so sharp on this city<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That by some chance or some treaty<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Thou mayest have her as lady and as wife<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For whom I must of necessity lose my life.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For, as by way of possibility,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Since thou art at thy liberty, free of prison,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And art a lord, thy advantage is great,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;More than is mine, who die here in a cage.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For I must weep and wail, while I live,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With all the woe that prison may give me,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And also with pain that love gives me also,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That doubles all my torment and my woe."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With that the fire of jealousy started up<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Within his breast, and seized him by the heart<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So madly that he was to look upon like <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The box tree or the ash dead and cold.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Then said he, "O cruel gods that govern<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This world with binding of your eternal word,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And write in the table of adamant (hardest of stones)<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Your decision and your eternal decree,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Why is mankind more obligated unto you <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Than is the sheep that cowers in the sheepfold?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For man is slain exactly like another beast,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And dwells also in prison and detention,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And has sickness and great adversity,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And often times guiltless, indeed.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"What (sort of) governance is in this foreknowledge,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That torments guiltless innocence?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And yet this increases all my suffering,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That man is bound to his duty,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For God's sake, to refrain from his desire,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Whereas a beast may fulfill all his desire.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And when a beast is dead he has no pain;   <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But man after his death must weep and lament,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Though in this world he may have (had) care and woe.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Without doubt such is the case.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The answer to this I leave to theologians,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But well I know that great pain is in this world.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Alas, I see a serpent or a thief,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That has done mischief to many a true man,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Go at his liberty, and can go where he pleases.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But I must be in prison because of Saturn,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And also because of Juno, jealous and also mad,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Who has destroyed well nigh all the blood<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Of Thebes with its wide devastated walls;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And Venus slays me on that other side<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For jealousy and fear of this Arcite."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Now will I cease (speaking of) of Palamon for a little while,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And leave him to dwell in his prison still,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And of Arcite forth I will tell you.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The summer passes, and the long nights <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Increase doubly the strong pains <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Both of the lover and the prisoner.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I know not which has the more woeful task.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For, briefly to say (it), this Palamon<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Is damned perpetually to prison,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In chains and in fetters to be dead;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And Arcite is exiled on threat of losing his head<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For evermore, out of that country,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nor nevermore shall see his lady.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Yow lovers now I ask this question:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Who has the worse, Arcite or Palamon?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That one may see his lady every day,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But in prison he must always dwell;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That other where he pleases may ride or walk,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But he shall see his lady nevermore.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Now judge as it pleases you, you who know (of such things),<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For I will tell forth as I began.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Whoa!" said the Knight, "good sire, no more of this!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What you have said is quite enough, indeed,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And much more; for a little sadness<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Is quite enough for many people, I guess.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I say for myself, it is a great distress,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When men have been in great wealth and ease,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To hear of their sudden fall, alas!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And the contrary is joy and great comfort,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As when a man has been in a poor condition,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And climbs up and becomes fortunate,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And there remains in prosperity.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Such a thing is pleasing, as it seems to me,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And of such a thing it would be good to tell."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Yea," said our Host, "by Saint Paul's bell!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You say the very truth; this Monk he chatters noisily.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He spoke of how Fortune covered with a cloud<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I know not what; and also of a tragedy<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Just now you heard, and by God, no remedy<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Is it to bewail or lament<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That which is done, and also it is a pain,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As you have said, to hear of sadness.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Sir Monk, no more of this, as God may you bless!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Your tale annoys all this company.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Such talking is not worth a butterfly,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For in it there is no pleasure nor amusement.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Therefore, Sir Monk, dan Piers by your name,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I pray yow earnestly tell us something else;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For truly, were it not for the clinking of your bells<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That on your bridle hang on every side,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; By heaven's King who for us all died,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I should before this have fallen down because of sleepiness,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Although the mud had never been so deep;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Then had your tale been told all in vain.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For certainly, as these clerks say,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Where a man may have no hearers,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It is no use to tell his opinion.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "And well I know the capacity of appreciation is in me,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If any thing shall be well told.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Sir, say something about hunting, I you pray."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Nay," said this Monk, "I have no desire to play.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Now let another tell, as I have told."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Then spoke oure Host with rude speech and bold,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And said unto the Nun's Priest straightway,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Come near, thou priest, come hither, thou sir John!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Tell us such thing as may our hearts gladden.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Be happy, though thou ride upon a nag.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What if thy horse be both poor and lean?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If he will serve thee, care not a bean.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; See that thy heart be merry evermore."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Yes indeed, sir," said he, "yes indeed, Host, as I may I prosper,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Unless I be merry, indeed I will be blamed."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And right away his tale he has begun,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And thus he said unto us every one,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This sweet priest, this goodly man sir John.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A poor widow, somewhat advanced in age,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Was once dwelling in a small cottage,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Beside a grove, standing in a dale.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This widow, of whom I tell you my tale,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Since that same day that she was last a wife<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In patience led a very simple life,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For little was her possessions and her income.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; By husbandry of such as God sent her<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She provided for herself and also her two daughters.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She had three large sows, and no more,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Three cows, and also a sheep that is called Malle.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Full sooty was her bedchamber and also her hall,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In which she ate very many a scanty meal.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She needed not a bit of spicy sauce.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; No dainty morsel passed through her throat; <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Her diet was such as her farm produced.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Overeating never made her sick; <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Moderate diet was all her medical treatment,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And exercise, and a contented heart.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The gout not at all prevented her from dancing,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And apoplexy harmed not her head.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; No wine she drank, neither white nor red; <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Her board was provided mostly with white and black --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Milk and dark bread, in which she found no lack,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Broiled bacon, and sometimes an egg or two,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For she was, as it were, a sort of dairywoman.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She had a yard, enclosed all around <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With sticks, and a dry ditch outside it,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In which she had a cock, called Chauntecleer.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In all the land, there was not his peer in crowing.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His voice was merrier than the merry organ<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That goes in the church on mass-days.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Well more accurate was his crowing in his lodge<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Than is a clock or an abbey timepiece.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; By nature he knew (the hour of) each ascension<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of the celestial equator in that same town; <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For when degrees fifteen were ascended,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Then he crowed so that it could not be improved.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His comb was redder than the fine coral,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And notched with battlements as if it were a castle wall; <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His bill was black, and it shone like the jet stone; <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Like azure were his legs and his toes; <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His nails whiter than the lily flour,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And like the burnished gold was his color.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This gentle cock had in his governance<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Seven hens to do all his pleasure,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Which were his sisters and his concubines,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And wonderfully like him, in their colors; <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of which the fairest colored on her throat<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Was called fair demoiselle Pertelote.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Courteous she was, discreet, and gracious,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And companionable, and bore herself so fair<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Since that same day that she was seven nights old<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That truly she has in possession the heart <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of Chauntecleer, locked in every limb (completely); <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He loved her so that well was him because of that.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But such a joy it was to hear them sing,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When the bright sun began to spring,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In sweet accord, "My love has gone to the country!" --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For in that same time, as I have understood,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Beasts and birds could speak and sing.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And so befell that in a dawning,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As Chauntecleer among all his wives<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Sat on his perch, that was in the hall,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And next to him sat this faire Pertelote,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This Chauntecleer began to groan in his throat,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As one that in his dream is deeply troubled.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And when Pertelote thus heard him roar,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She was aghast and said, "Dear heart,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What ails you, to groan in this manner?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You are a true (sound) sleeper; fie, for shame!"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And he answered, and said thus: "Madame,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I pray you that you take it not amiss.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; By God, I dreamed I was in such mischief<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Right now that yet my heart is grievously frightened.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Now God," said he, "interpret my dream correctly,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And keep my body out of foul prison!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I dreamed how I roamed up and down<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Within our yard, where I saw a beast<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Was like a hound, and would have seized <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Upon my body, and would have had me dead.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His color was between yellow and red,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And tipped was his tail and both his ears<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With black, unlike the rest of his hair; <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His snout small, with two glowing eyes.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Yet for fear of his look I almost die; <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This caused my groaning, doubtless."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Shame!" said she, "fie on you, coward!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Alas," said she, "for, by that God above,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Now have you lost my heart and all my love!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I can not love a coward, by my faith!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For certainly, whatever any woman says,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We all desire, if it might be,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To have husbands hardy, wise, and generous,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And secret -- and no miser, nor no fool,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Nor him who is afraid of every weapon,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Nor any boaster, by that God above!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; How dare you say, for shame, unto your love<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That any thing might make you afraid?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Have you no man's heart, and have a beard? <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Alas! And can you be frightened of dreams?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Nothing, God knows, but foolishness is in dreams.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Dreams are produced by overeating,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And often by stomach vapors and by the mixture of bodily humors,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When humors are too abundant in a person.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Certainly this dream, which you have dreamed to-night,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Comes of the great superfluity<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of your red choleric humor, indeed,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Which causes folk in their dreams to be afraid <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of arrows, and of fire with red flames,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of red beasts, (fearing) that they will bite them,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of strife, and of dogs, big and little; <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Right as the humor of melancholy<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Causes very many a man in sleep to cry<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For fear of black bears, or black bulls,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or else black devils will take them.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of other humors could I tell also<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That cause many a man much woe (in) sleep; <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But I will pass over as lightly as I can.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Lo Cato, who was so wise a man,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Said he not thus, `Attach no importance to dreams'?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Now sir," said she, "when we fly from the beams,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For God's love, take some laxative.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Upon peril of my soul and of my life,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I counsel you the best -- I will not lie --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That both of choler and of melancholy<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You purge yourself; and so that you shall not delay,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Though in this town is no apothecary,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I shall myself guide you to herbs <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That shall be for your health and for your benefit; <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And in our yard I shall find those herbs <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The which by nature have the power<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To purge you beneath and also above.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Forget not this, for God's own love!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You are dominated by the choleric humor; <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Beware the sun when it is high in the sky<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And do not find yourself with an excess of hot humors.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And if there be an excess, I dare well bet four pence,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That you shall have a fever recurring every three days,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or an ague that may be your death.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A day or two you shall have digestives<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of worms, before you take your laxatives<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of spurge laurel, centaury, and fumitory,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or else of hellebore, that grows there,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of caper-spurge, or of rhamus,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of ground ivy, growing in our yard, where it is pleasant; <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Peck them up right as they grow and eat them in.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Be merry, husband, for your father's kin!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Dread no dream; I can say you no more."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Madame," said he, "great thanks for your learning.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But nonetheless, as touching dan Cato,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That has of wisdom such a great renown,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Though he commanded (us) to dread no dreams,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; By God, men may in old books read<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of many a man of more authority<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Than Cato ever was, as I may prosper,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who say all the reverse of this sentence,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And have well found by experience<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That dreams are significations<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As well of joy as of tribulations<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That folk endure in this present life.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There need be no argument about this; <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The proof itself shows it in the deed.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "One of the greatest author that men read<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Says thus: that once two fellows went<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; On pilgrimage, with a very good intention,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And it so happened, they came in a town<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Where there was such a gathering<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of people, and also such a scantiness of lodging,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That they found not so much as one cottage<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In which they both might be lodged.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Therefore they must of necessity,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For that night, part company; <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And each of them goes to his hostelry,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And took his lodging as it would befall.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The one of them was lodged in a stall,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Far in a yard, with oxen of the plough; <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That other man was lodged well enough,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As was his adventure or his fortune,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Which us governs all in common.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "And it so befell that, long before it was day,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This man dreamed in his bed, where he lay,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; How his fellow began to call upon him,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And said, `Alas, for in an oxen's stall<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This night I shall be murdered where I lie!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Now help me, dear brother, or I die.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In all haste come to me!' he said.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This man out of his sleep for fear awakened suddenly; <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But when he was wakened of his sleep,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He turned himself and took no heed of this.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He thought his dream was nothing but a fantasy.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thus twice in his sleeping he dreamed; <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And at third time yet his fellow<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Came, as it seemed to him, and said, `I am now slain.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Behold my bloody wounds deep and wide!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Arise up early in the morning time,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And at the west gate of the town,' he said,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; `A cart full of dung there shalt thou see,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In which my body is hid very secretly; <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Have that same cart immediately seized.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; My gold caused my murder, to say the truth,'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And told him in full detail how he was slain,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With a very piteous face, pale of hue.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And trust well, his dream he found very true,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For on the morrow, as soon as it was day,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To his fellow's inn he took the way; <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And when he came to this oxen's stall,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; After his fellow he began to call.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "The innkeeper answered him straightway,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And said, `Sir, your fellow is gone.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As soon as it was day he went out of the town.'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "This man began to fall in suspicion,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Remembering his dreams that he dreamed,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And forth he goes -- no longer would he delay --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Unto the west gate of the town, and found<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A dung-cart, which went as if it were to dung land,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That was drawn up in that same manner<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As you have heard the dead man tell.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And with a hardy heart he began to cry for<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Vengeance and justice of this felony:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; `My fellow is murdered this same night,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And in this cart he lies gaping upright.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I cry out on the officials,' said he,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; `Who should guard and rule this city.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Help! Alas! Here lies my fellow slain!'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What should I more unto this tale say?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The people rushed out and cast the cart to ground,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And in the middle of the dung they found<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The dead man, who was just recently murdered.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "O blissful God, that art so just and true,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Lo, how thou always reveal murder!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Murder will out; we see that day by day.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Murder is so disgusting and abominable<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To God, who is so just and reasonable,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That He will not suffer it to be hidden,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Though it may wait a year, or two, or three.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Murder will out, this is my conclusion.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And immediately, officials of that town<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Have seized the carter and so painfully tortured him,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And also the hosteller so grievously tortured,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That they straightway acknowledged their wickedness,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And were hanged by the neck-bone.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Here men may seen that dreams are to be feared.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And certainly in the same book I read,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Right in the next chapter after this --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I do not lie, as I may have joy or bliss --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Two men that would have passed over see,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For a certain reason, into a far country,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If that the wind had not been contrary,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That made them to tarry in a city <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That stood very merrily upon an haven-side; <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But on a day, toward the evening time,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The wind began to change, and blew exactly as they desired.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Jolly and glad they went unto their rest,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And they planned to sail very early.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But listen! To that one man befell a great marvel:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The one of them, in sleeping as he lay,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He dreamed a wondrous dream before the day.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He thought a man stood by his bed's side,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And commanded him that he should stay,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And said to him thus: `If thou travel tomorrow,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thou shalt be drowned; my tale is at an end.'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He woke, and told his fellow what he dreamed,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And prayed him to delay his voyage; <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For that day, he prayed him to wait.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His fellow, that lay by his bed's side,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Began to laugh, and vigorously scorned him.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; `No dream,' said he, `may so frighten my heart<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That I will desist from doing my tasks.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I set not a straw by (put no value on) thy dreams,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For dreams are but fantasies and foolishness.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Men dream all the time of owls and of apes,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And of many a source of amazement indeed; <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Men dream of a thing that never was nor shall be.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But since I see that thou will remain here,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And thus willfully waste thy tide,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; God knows, it makes me sorry; and have good day!'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And thus he took his leave, and went his way.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But before he had sailed half his course,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I know not why, nor what mischance harmed it,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But by chance the ship's bottom broke open,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And ship and man went under the water <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In sight of other ships beside it,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That with them sailed on the same tide.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And therefore, faire Pertelote so dear,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; By such old examples thou may learn<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That no man should be too heedless<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of dreams; for I say to thee, doubtless,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That many a dream is very greatly to be feared.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Lo, I read in the life of Saint Kenelm,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That was son of Kenulphus, the noble king<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of Mercia, how Kenelm dreamed a thing.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A little before he was murdered, on a day,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He saw his murder in his vision.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His nurse completely explained to him<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His dream, and ordered him to guard himself well<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; From treason; but he was only seven years old,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And therefore he put little store<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In any dream, so holy was his heart.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; By God! I had rather than my shirt (give my shirt)<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That you had read his legend, as have I.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Dame Pertelote, I say you truly,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Macrobius, that wrote the vision<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In Africa of the worthy Scipio,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Affirms (the value of) dreams, and says that they are<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Warnings of things that men later see (come to pass)<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And furthermore, I pray you, look well<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In the Old Testament, concerning Daniel,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If he held dreams (to be) any foolishness.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Read also of Joseph, and there shall you see<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Whether dreams are sometimes -- I say not all --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Warnings of things that shall afterward befall.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Consider the king of Egypt, dan Pharaoh,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His baker and his butler also,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Whether or not they felt any effect in dreams.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Whoever will seek out the histories of various nations<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; May read many a wonderful thing about dreams.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Lo Croesus, who was king of Lydia,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Dreamed he not that he sat upon a tree,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Which signified he should be hanged?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Lo here Andromacha, Hector's wife,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That day that Hector should lose his life,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She dreamed on the same night before<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; How the life of Hector should be lost,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If that same day he went into battle.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She warned him, but it might not avail; <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He went to fight nonetheless,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But he was slain straightway by Achilles.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But that same tale is all too long to tell,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And also it is nigh day; I may not delay.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Shortly I say, as for conclusion,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That I shall have of this vision<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Adversity; and I say furthermore<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That I put no store in laxatives,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For they are poisonous, I know it well; <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I renounce them, I love them not at all!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Now let us speak of mirth, and stop all this.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Madame Pertelote, as I may have bliss,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of one thing God has sent me a great favor; <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For when I see the beauty of your face,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You are so scarlet red about your eyes,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It makes all my dread die; <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For as surely as `In the beginning,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; `Woman is the ruin of man --'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Madame, the meaning of this Latin is,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; `Woman is man's joy and all his bliss.'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For when I feel at night your soft side --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Although I can not on you ride,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Because our perch is made so narrow, alas --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I am so full of joy and of pleasure,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That I renounce both vision and dream."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And with that word he flew down from the beam,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For it was day, and also all his hens,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And with a cluck he began to call them,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Because he had found a seed, which lay in the yard.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Royal he was, he was no longer afraid.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He embraced Pertelote twenty times,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And copulated with her also as often, before it was 6 a.m..<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He looks as if he were a grim lion,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And on his toes he roams up and down; <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He deigned not to set his foot to ground.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He clucks when he has found a seed,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And then his wives all run to him.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thus royal, as a prince is in his hall,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Leave I this Chauntecleer in his feeding place,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And after I will tell his adventure.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When the month in which the world began,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Which is called March, when God first made man,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Was complete, and passed were also,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Since March had gone, thirty days and two,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Befell that Chauntecleer in all his pride,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His seven wives walking by his side,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Cast up his eyes to the bright sun,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That in the sign of Taurus had run<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Twenty degrees and one, and somewhat more,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And knew by nature, and by none other knowledge,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That it was prime, and crowed with blissful voice.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "The sun," he said, "has climbed up on heaven<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Forty degrees and one, and more indeed.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Madame Pertelote, my world's bliss,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Listen to these blissful birds, how they sing,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And see the fresh flowers, how they spring; <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; My heart is full of revel and pleasure!"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But suddenly to him befell a sorrowful situation,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For ever the latter end of joy is woe.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; God knows that worldly joy is soon gone; <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And if a rhetorician could fairly compose,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He in a chronicle confidently could write it <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As a supremely important fact.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Now every wise man, let him listen to me; <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This story is as true, I declare,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As is the Book of Lancelot of the Lake,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Which women hold in very great reverence.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Now will I turn again to my subject matter.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A fox, full of sly iniquity,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That in the grove had dwelled three years,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; By exalted imagination predestined,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The same night through the hedges broke<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Into the yard where the handsome Chauntecleer<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Was accustomed, and also his wives, to repair; <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And in a bed of cabbages he lay quietly<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Until it had passed 9 a.m. of the day,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Waiting his time on Chauntecleer to fall,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As habitually do all these homicides<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That in ambush lie to murder men.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; O false murderer, lurking in thy den!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; O new Judas Iscariot, new Genylon,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; False deceiver, O Greek Synon,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That brought all Troy completely to sorrow!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; O Chauntecleer, cursed be that morning<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That thou flew from the beams into that yard!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thou were very well warned by thy dreams<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That that same day was perilous to thee; <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But what God knows beforehand must by necessity be,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; According to the opinion of certain scholars.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Take witness of him that is a thoroughly competent scholar,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That in the university is great disagreement<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In this matter, and great disputation,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And has been (disputed) by a hundred thousand men.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But I can not separate the valid and invalid arguments<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As can the holy doctor Augustine,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or Boethius, or the Bishop Bradwardyn,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Whether God's worthy foreknowledge<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Constrains me by need to do a thing --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Need" I call simple necessity --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or else, if free choice be granted to me<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To do that same thing, or do it not,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Though God knew it before I was born; <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or if his knowledge constrains not at all<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But by conditional necessity. <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I will not have to do with such matter; <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; My tale is of a cock, as you may hear,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who took his counsel from his wife, with sorrow,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To walk in the yard upon that morning<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That he had dreamed that dream of which I told you.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Women's counsels are very often fatal; <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Woman's counsel brought us first to woe<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And made Adam to go from Paradise,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Where he was very merry and well at ease.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But because I know not to whom it might displease,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If I would blame counsel of women,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Pass over, for I said it as a joke.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Read authors, where they treat of such matter,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And what they say of women you may hear.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; These are the cock's words, and not mine; <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I know no harm of any woman divine. <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Fair in the sand, to bathe her merrily,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Lies Pertelote, and all her sisters by her,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In the sunshine, and Chauntecleer so noble<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Sang more merrily than the mermaid in the sea<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (For Phisiologus says surely<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; How they sing well and merrily).<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And so befell that, as he cast his eye<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; On a butterfly among the cabbages,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He was aware of this fox, that lay very low.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Not at all then did he want to crow,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But cried straightway, "Cock! cock!" and up he leaped<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As one that was frightened in his heart.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For naturally a beast desires to flee<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; From his natural opponent, if he may see it,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Though he never before had seen it with his eye.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This Chauntecleer, when he did espy him,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He would have fled, but that the fox straightway<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Said, "Gentle sir, alas, where will you go?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Are you afraid of me who is your friend?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Now, certainly, I would be worse than a fiend,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If I to you would do harm or villainy!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I am not come to spy on your secrets,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But truly, the cause of my coming<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Was only to hear how you sing.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For truly, you have as merry a voice<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As has any angel that is in heaven.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Therewith you have in music more feeling<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Than had Boethius, or any that knows how to sing.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; My lord your father -- God bless his soul! --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And also your mother, of her graciousness,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Have been in my house to my great pleasure; <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And certainly, sir, I would very eagerly please you.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But, insofar as men speak of singing, I will say --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As I may well have use of my two eyes --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Except for you, I heard never man so sing<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As did your father in the morning.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Certainly, it came from the heart, all that he sang.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And to make his voice the more strong,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He would so exert himself that with both his eyes<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He had to wink, so loud he would cry,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And stand on his tiptoes simultaneously,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And stretch forth his neck long and small.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And also he was of such sound judgment <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That there was no man in any region<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That might pass him in song or wisdom.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I have well read in `Dan Burnel the Ass,'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Among his verses, how there was a cock,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Because a priest's son gave him a knock<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Upon his leg while he was young and foolish,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He made him lose his benefice.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But certainly, there is no comparison<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Between the wisdom and discretion<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of your father and of his subtlety.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Now sing, sir, for Saint Charity; <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Let's see; can you imitate your father?"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This Chauntecleer began to beat his wings,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As one that could not espy his treason,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He was so ravished with his flattery.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Alas, you lords, many a false flatterer<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Is in your courts, and many a sycophant,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who please you well more, by my faith,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Than he who says the truth unto you.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Read Ecclesiastes about flattery; <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Beware, you lords, of their treachery.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This Chauntecleer stood high upon his toes,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Stretching his neck, and held his eyes closed,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And began to crow loud for the occasion.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And dan Russell the fox leaped up at once,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And grabbed Chauntecleer by the throat,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And carried him on his back toward the woods,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For yet there was no one that pursued him.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; O destiny, that may not be escaped!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Alas, that Chauntecleer flew from the beams!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Alas, his wife took no heed of dreams!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And on a Friday befell all this misfortune.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; O Venus, who art goddess of pleasure,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Since this Chauntecleer was thy servant,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And in thy service did all his power,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; More for delight than to people the world,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Why wouldest thou allow him to die on thy day?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; O Gaufred, dear supreme master,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who when thy worthy king Richard was slain<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; By shot of an arrow, complained his death so grievously,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Why had I not now thy wisdom and thy learning,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To chide the Friday, as you did?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For on a Friday, truly, he was slain.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Then would I show you how that I could complain<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For Chanticleer's dread and for his pain.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Certainly, such cry nor lamentation<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Was never made by ladies when Ilion (Troy)<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Was won, and Pirrus with his drawn sword,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When he had seized king Priam by the beard,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And slain him, as the Aeneid tells us,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As all the hens made in the yard,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When they had seen the sight of Chauntecleer.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But supremely dame Pertelote shrieked<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Much louder than did Hasdrubales' wife,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When her husband had lost his life<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And the Romans had burned Carthage.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She was so full of torment and of rage<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That willfully into the fire she leaped<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And burned herself with a steadfast heart.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; O woeful hens, exactly so you cried<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As when Nero burned the city<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of Rome senators' wives cried <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Because their husbands lost all their lives --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Without guilt this Nero has them slain.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Now will I turn to my tale again.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This poor widow and also her two daughters<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Heard these hens cry and make woe,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And out at doors they rush anon,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And see the fox go toward the grove,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And carried the cock away upon his back,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And cried, "Help! Help and alas!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Ha, ha! The fox!" and after him they ran,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And also with staves many another man.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Ran Colle our dog, and Talbot and Gerland,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And Malkyn, with a distaff in her hand; <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Ran cow and calf, and also the very hogs,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So frightened for the barking of the dogs<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And shouting of the men and women also<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They ran so hard that they thought their hearts would break.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They yelled as fiends do in hell; <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The ducks cried as if men would them kill; <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The geese for fear flew over the trees; <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Out of the hive came the swarm of bees.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So hideous was the noise -- a, bless me! --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Certainly, he Jack Straw and his company<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Never made shouts half so shrill<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When they would any Fleming kill,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As that same day was made upon the fox.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They brought trumpets of brass, and of box-wood,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of horn, of bone, in which they blew and puffed,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And with that they shrieked and they whooped.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It seemed as if heaven should fall.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Now, good men, I pray you all to listen:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Lo, how Fortune turns suddenly<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The hope and pride also of her enemy!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This cock, that lay upon the fox's back,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In all his dread unto the fox he spoke,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And said, "Sir, if I were you,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Yet should I say, as God may help me,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; `Turn again, all you proud churls!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; May a true pestilence fall upon you!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Now I am come unto the wood's side; <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Despite all you could do, the cock shall here remain.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I will eat him, in faith, and that right away!'"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The fox answered, "In faith, it shall be done."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And as he spoke that word, all suddenly<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This cock nimbly broke from his mouth,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And high upon a tree he quickly flew.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And when the fox saw that the cock was gone,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Alas!" said he, "O Chauntecleer, alas!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I have to you," said he, "done offense,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In as much as I made you afraid<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When I seized you and brought you out of the yard.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But, sir, I did it with no wicked intention.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Come down, and I shall tell you what I meant; <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I shall say the truth to you, as God may help me!"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Nay then," said he, "I curse both of us two.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And first I curse myself, both blood and bones,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If thou trick me more often than once.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thou shalt no more through thy flattery<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Make me sing and close my eyes; <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For he that closes his eyes, when he should see,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; All willfully, God let him never prosper!"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Nay," said the fox, "but God give him misfortune,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who is so indiscreet of governance<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That he chatters when he should hold his peace."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Lo, such it is to be careless<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And negligent, and trust on flattery.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But you who hold this tale a folly,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As of a fox, or of a cock and hen,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Take the morality, good men.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For Saint Paul says that all that is written,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Is written for our instruction, indeed; <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Take the fruit, and let the chaff be still.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Now, good God, if it be thy will,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As says my lord, make us all good men,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And bring us to his high bliss! Amen.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ["Sir Nun's Priest," our Host said straightway,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Blessed be thy buttocks, and every testicle!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This was a merry tale of Chanticleer.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But by my troth, if thou were a layman,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thou would be an excellent copulator of fouls (rooster).<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For if thou have as much desire as thou hast might,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thou would have need of hens, as I think,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Yea, more than seven times seventeen.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; See, what muscles has this gentle priest,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So big a neck, and such a large chest!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He looks like a sparrow-hauk with his eyes;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He needs not paint his complexion<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With red dye nor with grain of Portugal.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Now, sir, may good fortune come to you for your tale!"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And after that he, with a very merry manner,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Said unto another, as you shall hear.]<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Once there was dwelling in my country<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; An archdeacon, a man of high rank,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That boldly carried out the law<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In punishment of fornication,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of witchcraft, and also of pandering,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of defamation of character, and adultery,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of robbing churches, and of wills,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of marriage contracts and of failure to take the sacraments,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of usury, and of simony also.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But certainly, to lechers did he the greatest woe;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They had to sing out in pain if they were taken;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And those who paid less than full tithes were severely punished,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If any parson would complain about them.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There could escape him no monetary punishment (fine).<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For small tithes and for small offering<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He made the people piteously to sing out in pain,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For ere the bishop caught them with his crozier,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They were in the archdeacon's book.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Then had he, throughout his jurisdiction,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Power to have them punished.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He had a summoner ready at his hand;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; No one in England was a more clever rascal;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For deviously he had his network of spies,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That showed him well where there might be profit for him.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He could spare one or two of the lechers,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To direct him to four and twenty more.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For though this Summoner were mad as a hare,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To tell his wickedness I will not desist;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For we are exempt from his authority.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They have over us no jurisdiction,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Nor never shall, until the end of all their lives.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "By St. Peter! so are women of the brothels,"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Said the Summoner, "put out of our jurisdiction!"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Quiet! with bad luck and with misfortune to you!"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thus said our Host, "and let him tell his tale.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Now tell forth, though the Summoner loudly complain;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And tell everything, my own master dear."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This false thief, this summoner, said the Friar,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Had always pimps as ready to his hand,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As any hawk to come to the lure in England,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who told him all the secrets that they knew,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For their acquaintance was not come recently.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They were secretly his agents.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He got himself a great profit in this way;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His master knew not always what he earned.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Without an actual summons an ignorant man<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He could summon, on pain of excommunication,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And they were glad to fill his purse<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And make him great feasts at the ale-house.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And just as Judas had small amounts of the apostles' money,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And was a thief, exactly such a thief was he;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His master had but half the amount due to him.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He was, if I shall give him his due praise,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A thief, and also a summoner, and a pimp.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He had also wenches in his employ,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That, whether sir Robert or sir Huwe,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or Jakke, or Rauf, or whoever it was<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That lay by them, they told it in his ear.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thus were the wench and he in agreement,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And he would fetch a forged court order,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And summon both of them to the archdeacon's court,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And rob the man, and let the wench go.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Then would he say, "Friend, I shall for thy sake<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Have her stricken out of our records;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thou need trouble thyself no more in this case.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I am thy friend, where I can help thee."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Certainly he knew of more ways of stealing<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Than is possible to tell in two years.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For in this world is no hunting dog<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That can know a hurt deer from a whole one<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Better than this summoner knew a sly lecher,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or an adulterer, or a concubine.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And because that was the best part of all his income,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Therefore on it he set all his intention.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And it so befell that once on a day<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This summoner, ever lying in ambush for his prey,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Rode to summon an old widow, an old crone,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Pretending to have a case against her, for he wanted a bribe.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And it happened that he saw before him ride<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A gay yeoman, alongside the edge of a forest.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A bow he bore, and arrows bright and keen;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He had upon him a short jacket of green,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A hat upon his head with fringes black.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Sir," said this summoner, "hail, and well met!"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Welcome," said he, "and every good fellow!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Where ridest thou, alongside this green wood?"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Said this yeoman, "Wilt thou travel far today?"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This summoner him answered and said, "Nay;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Here close by," said he, "is my intention<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To ride, to collect a rent<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That belongs to my lord's due income."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Art thou then a bailiff?" "Yes," said he.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He dared not, for the true filth and shame<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of the name, say that he was a summoner.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "By God," said this yeoman, "dear brother,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thou art a bailiff, and I am another.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I am unknown in this country;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of thine acquaintance I would pray thee,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And also of brotherhood, if you wish.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I have gold and silver in my chest;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If thou happen to come in our shire,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; All shall be thine, just as thou wilt desire."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Great thanks," said this summoner, "by my faith!"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Each in other's hand pledges his troth,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To be sworn brothers until they die.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In pleasant conversation they ride forth and amuse themselves.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This summoner, who was as full of idle speech<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As full of venom are these butcherbirds<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And ever inquiring about every thing,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Brother," said he, "where is now your dwelling<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If I should seek you another day?"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This yeoman him answered in gentle words,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Brother," said he, "far in the north country,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Where I hope some time I shall thee see.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Ere we depart, I shall thee so well instruct<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That thou shalt never miss my house."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Now, brother," said this summoner, "I you pray,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Teach me, while we ride by the way,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Since you are a bailiff as am I,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Some trickery, and tell me faithfully<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In my occupation how I may most profit;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And spare not for conscience nor sin,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But as my brother tell me, how you do your business."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Now, by my troth, brother dear," said he,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "I shall tell thee a true tale,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; My wages are very scanty and very small.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; My lord is hard to me and niggardly,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And my job is very hard work,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And therefore by extortions I live.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For truly, I take all that men will me give.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In every way, by trickery or by violence,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; From year to year I earn all my expenses.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I can no better tell, truthfully."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Now certainly," said this Summoner, "I do the same.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I do not desist from taking anything, God knows,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Unless it be too heavy or too hot.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What I can get in private secretly,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; No sort of pangs of conscience for that have I.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Were it not for my extortion, I could not live,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Nor of such tricks will I be confessed.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Stomach (compassion) nor conscience know I none;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I curse these confessors every one.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Well are we met, by God and by Saint James!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But, dear brother, tell me then thy name,"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Said this summoner. Meanwhile<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This yeoman began a little to smile.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Brother," said he, "wilt thou that I thee tell?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I am a fiend; my dwelling is in hell,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And here I ride about on my acquisition of profits,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To know whether men will give me any thing.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What I acquire is the total of all my income.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Look how thou ridest for the same purpose,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To make a profit, thou carest never how;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Right so do I, for I would ride now<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Unto the world's end for a prey."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Ah!" said this summoner, "bless me! What say you?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I supposed you were truly a yeoman.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You have a man's shape as well as I;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Have you then a definite form<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In hell, where you are in your usual condition?"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Nay, certainly," said he, "there have we none;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But when we like we can take us one,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or else make it seem to you we are so shaped;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Sometimes like a man, or like an ape,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or like an angel can I ride or walk about.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It is no wonderful thing though it be so;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A lousy conjurer can deceive thee,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And by God, yet I know more craft than he."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Why," said this summoner, "ride you then or walk about<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In various shapes, and not always in one?"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Because we," said he, "will make us such forms<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As are most suitable for taking our prey."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "What makes you to have all this labor?"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Very many a cause, dear sir summoner,"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Said this fiend, "but every thing has its time.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The day is short, and it is past nine a.m.,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And yet I gained nothing in this day.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I will concentrate on profit, if I may,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And not attend to explaining our mental abilities.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For, brother mine, thy wit is all too bare<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To understand, even though I told them to thee.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But, since thou askest why labor we --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For sometimes we are God's instruments<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And means to do his commandments,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When he wishes, upon his creatures,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In various methods and in various appearances.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Without him we have no power, certainly,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If he wishes to stand against us.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And sometimes, at our prayer, have we leave<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Only the body and not the soul to grieve;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Take the evidence of Job, to whom we did woe.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And sometimes have we power over both of the two --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This is to say, of soul and body as well.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And sometimes we are allowed to harass<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A man and do his soul distress<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And not his body, and all is for the best.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When he withstands our temptation,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It is a cause of his salvation,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Although it was not our intention<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He should be saved, but that we wanted to seize him.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And sometimes we are servants unto a man,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As to the archbishop Saint Dunstan,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And to the apostles I was also a servant."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Yet tell me," said the summoner, "truly,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Do you make yourself new bodies thus always<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of elements?" The fiend answered, "Nay.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Sometime we dissemble, and sometimes we arise<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With dead bodies, in very many manners,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And speak as readily and faire and well<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As to the Phitonissa (Witch of Endor) did Samuel.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (And yet will some men say it was not he;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I put no store in your theology.)<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But one thing I warn thee, I will not deceive you:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thou want especially to know how we are shaped;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thou shalt hereafter, my brother dear,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Come where thou need not to learn from me,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For thou shalt, by thine own experience,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Be able in a professorial chair to lecture on this subject<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Better than Virgil, while he was alive,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or Dante also. Now let us ride quickly,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For I will hold company with thee<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Until it be that thou forsake me."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Nay," said this summoner, "that shall not happen!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I am a yeoman, as is very widely known;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; My troth will I keep, in this case.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For though thou were the devil Satan,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; My troth will I hold to my brother,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As I am sworn, and each of us to the other,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To be true brother in this case;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And we both go about our acquisitions.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Take thou thy part, whatever men will thee give,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And I shall mine; thus may we both live.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And if one of us have more than the other,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Let him be true and share it with his brother."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "I grant," said the devil, "by my faith."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And with that word they ride forth their way.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And right at the entrance of the town,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To which this summoner planned to go<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They saw a cart that was loaded with hay,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Which a carter drove forth in his way.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Deep in mud was the road, for which the cart stood still.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The carter smote and cried as if he were crazy,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Giddap, Brok! Giddap, Scot! Why do you stop pulling for the stones?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The fiend," said he, "fetch you, body and bones,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As surely as ever you were born,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So much woe as I have with you suffered!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The devil have all, both horses and cart and hay!"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This summoner said, "Here shall we have some fun."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And nearer the fiend he drew, as if it were nothing,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Very discreetly, and whispered in his ear:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Hearken, my brother, hearken, by thy faith!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Hearest thou not what the carter says?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Seize it at once, for he has given it to thee,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Both hay and cart, and also his three horses."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Nay," said the devil, "God knows, never a bit!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It is not his intention, trust me well.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Ask him thyself, if thou not believe me;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or else wait a while, and thou shalt see."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This carter whacks his horses upon the hindquarters,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And they began to pull and to stoop.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Giddap! Now," said he, "may Jesus Christ you bless,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And all his handiwork, both more and less!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That was well pulled, my own dappled boy.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I pray God save thee, and Saint Loy!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Now is my cart out of the mud, by God!"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Lo, brother," said the fiend, "what told I thee?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Here may you see, my own dear brother,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The churl spoke one thing, but he thought another.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Let us go forth on our undertaking;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Here gain I nothing from a tax on horse and cart."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When they came a short way out of town,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This summoner to his brother began to whisper:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Brother," said he, "here dwells an old crone<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who would be almost as willing to lose her neck<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As to give up a penny of her goods.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I will have twelve pence, even if she be driven mad,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or I will summon her unto our court;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And yet, God knows, of her know I no vice.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But since thou can not, in this country,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Earn thy living, learn here by my example."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This summoner knocks at the widow's gate.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Come out," said he, "thou old hag!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I believe thou hast some friar or priest with thee."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Who knocks?" said this wife, "bless me!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; God save you, sir, what is your sweet will?"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "I have," said he, "here a writ of summons;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Upon pain of excommunication, look that thou be<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Tomorrow morning before the archdeacon's knee<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To answer to the court about certain things."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Now, Lord," said she, "Christ Jesus, king of kings,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Surely help me, since I can not.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I have been sick, and that full many a day.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I can not walk so far," said she, "nor ride,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Without being dead, it so pains in my side.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; May I not ask for a written copy of the charge, sir summoner,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And answer there by my representative<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To such thing as men will bring against me?"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Yes," said this summoner, "pay at once -- let's see --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Twelve pens to me, and I will thee acquit.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I shall have no profit thereby but little;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; My master has the profit and not I.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Hurry up, and let me ride hastily;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Give me twelve pens, I can no longer tarry."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Twelve pence!" said she, "Now, lady Saint Marie<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Surely help me out of care and sin,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Though I should gain this wide world (if I had it),<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I have not twelve pence within my possession.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You know well that I am poor and old;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Show your charity on me, poor wretch."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Nay then," said he, "the foul fiend me fetch<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If I excuse thee, though thou should be dead!"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Alas!" said she, "God knows, I have no guilt."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Pay me," said he, "or by the sweet Saint Anne,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I will carry off thy new pan<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For debt which thou owest me since long ago.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When thou madest thine husband cuckold,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I paid at our court the fine for thy punishment."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Thou lie!" said she, "by my salvation,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I was never ere now, widow nor wife,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Summoned unto your court in all my life;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Nor was I ever anything but true of my body!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Unto the devil black and rough of appearance<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Give I thy body and my pan also!"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And when the devil heard her so curse<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Upon her knees, he said in this manner,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Now, Mabely, my own mother dear,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Is this your will in earnest that you say?"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "The devil," said she, "so fetch him ere he die,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And pan and all, unless he will repent!"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Nay, old slut, that is not my intention,"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Said this summoner, "to repent<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For any thing that I have had of thee.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I would I had thy smock and every bit of your clothing!"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Now, brother," said the devil, "be not angry;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thy body and this pan are mine by right.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thou shalt go with me to hell yet tonight,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Where thou shalt know of our secrets<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; More than a Master of Divinity."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And with that word this foul fiend seized him;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Body and soul he with the devil went<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Where summoners have their heritage.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And God, that made after his image<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Mankind, save and guide us, one and all,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And grant that these summoners become good men!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Gentlemen, I could have told you, said this Friar,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Had I had been given time by this Summoner here,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; According to the text of Christ, Paul, and John,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And of our other doctors of the Church many a one,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Such pains that your hearts might tremble,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Even though no tongue can describe it,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Though I could for a thousand years tell<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The pains of that cursed house of hell.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But to keep us from that cursed place,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Keep vigil and pray Jesus for his grace<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To protect us from the tempter Satan.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Hearken this word! Beware, as in this case:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "The lion sits in his ambush always<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To slay the innocent, if he can."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Dispose always your hearts to withstand<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The fiend, who would make you thrall and enslaved.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He may not tempt you beyond your power,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For Christ will be your champion and knight.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And pray that these summoners themselves repent<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of their misdeeds, ere the fiend seize them!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; [The first part ends.] <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; [The second part follows.] 
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I saw never ere now no bird nor beast<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That treated himself so piteously.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You slay me with your sorrow truly,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I have of you such great compassion.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For God's love, come down from the tree;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And as I am a king's daughter true,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If that I truly knew the cause<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of your malady, if it lay in my power,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I would amend it ere it were night,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So help me great God of nature!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And herbs shall I in abundance find<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With which to heal your hurts quickly."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Then shrieked this falcon yet more pitifully<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Than ever she did, and fell to ground straightway,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And lies in a swoon, dead and like a stone,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Until Canacee has in her lap her taken<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Until the time she awoke from the swoon.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And after she started up from her swoon,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Right in her hawk's language thus she said:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "That pity runs soon in a gentle heart,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Feeling its counterpart in sharp pains,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Is proven every day, as men may it see,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As well by deeds as by written authority;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For a gentle heart makes known its noble character.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I see well that you have of my distress<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Compassion, my faire Canacee,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Out of true womanly goodness<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That Nature in your natural disposition has set.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But for no hope to fare the better,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But to obey unto your heart noble,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And to make others be warned by my example,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As by the whelp chastised is the lion,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Right for that cause and to that conclusion,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; While that I have the time and the opportunity,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; My harm I will reveal ere I go away."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And ever, while that one her sorrow told,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That other wept as she would turn to water<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Until the falcon prayed her to be still,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And, with a sigh, right thus she spoke her mind:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Where I was bred -- alas, that same day! --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And fostered on a cliff of marble gray<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So tenderly that no thing ailed me,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I knew not what was adversity<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Until I could fly full high under the sky.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Then dwelt a male falcon very near me,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That seemed an exemplar of all nobility;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Although he was full of treason and falseness,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It was so concealed under humble bearing,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And under the appearance of truth in such a manner,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Under pleasantness, and under careful attentiveness,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That no creature could have supposed he could feign,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So deeply in a fast dye he dyed his true colors.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Just as a serpent hides himself under flowers<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Until he can see his time to bite,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Just so this god of love's hypocrite<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So does his ceremonies and obeisances,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And keeps in outward appearance all his observances<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That are in accord with nobility in love.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As in a tomb all the beauty is above,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And under is the corpse, as you know,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Such was this hypocrite, in every circumstance.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And in this manner he served his own purpose<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So that, except for the fiend, no one knew what he meant,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Until he so long had wept and complained,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And many a year his service to me feigned,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Until my heart, too compassionate and too naive,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Entirely ignorant of his consummate malice,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Very frightened that he might die, as it seemed to me,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Upon receiving his oaths and his pledges,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Granted him love, upon this condition,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That evermore my honor and renown<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Were safe, both in private and in public (in all ways);<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This is to say, that according to his deserts,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I gave him all my heart and all my thought --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; God knows and he, I would not have agreed on any other terms --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And took his heart in exchange for mine for ever.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But truly it is said, since many a day gone by,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; `An honest creature and a thief think not alike.'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And when he saw the business so far advanced<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That I had granted him fully my love<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In such a manner as I have said above,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And gave him my true heart as freely<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As he swore he gave his heart to me,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Immediately
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Fell on his knees with such devout humility,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With such high reverence, and, as seemed by his appearance,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So like a gentle lover in his manners,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So ravished, as it seemed, for the joy<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That never Jason nor Paris of Troy --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Jason? certainly, nor any other man<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Since Lameth was, he who first of all began<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To love two, as folk wrote long ago --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Nor ever, since the first man was born,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Could (any) man, by (so much as) one twenty thousandth,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Reproduce the deceptive sophisms of his art,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Nor were worthy to unbuckle his galosh,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Where duplicity or feigning were concerned,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Nor so could thank a creature as he did to me!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His manner was a heaven to see<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For any woman, were she never so wise,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So painted he and made himself elegant in every way,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Both his words and his countenance.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And I so loved him for his obeisance,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And for the truth I believed was in his heart,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That if it so were that any thing pained him,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Although it were never so little, and I knew of it,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It seemed to me I felt death twist my heart.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And shortly, this business had gone forth so far<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That my will was his will's instrument;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This is to say, my will obeyed his will<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In all things, so far as was consonant with reason,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Keeping ever the limits set by my honor.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Nor never loved anyone more, or even as much<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As him, God knows, nor never shall again.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "This lasted longer than a year or two,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That I supposed of him nothing but good.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But finally, thus at the last it stood,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That Fortune would have it that he must depart<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Out of that place where I was.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Whether I was woeful, there is no question;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I can not make a description of it.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For one thing I dare tell boldly:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; By this experience I know what is the pain of death;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Such harm I felt because he could not remain.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So one day he took his leave of me,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So sorrowfully also that I believed truly<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That he had felt as much harm as I,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When I heard him speak and saw his appearance.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But nevertheless, I thought he was so true,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And also that he should return again<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Within a little while, to say the truth;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And it was reasonable also that he must go<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For his honor, as often it happens so,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So that I made virtue of necessity,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And took it well, since it had to be.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As I best could, I hid from him my sorrow,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And took him by the hand, with Saint John as my guarantor,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And said to him thus: `Lo, I am all yours;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Be to me such as I to you have been and shall be.'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What he answered, it needs not be repeated;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who can speak better than he, who can act worse?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When he has said everything well, then he has done (all he will do).<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; `Therefore she must have a very long spoon<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who shall eat with a fiend,' thus I have heard said.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So at the last he had to go forth on his way,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And forth he speeds until he came where he pleased.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When he decided to rest,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I believe he had that text in mind,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That `every thing, by returning to its natural state,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Makes himself happy;' thus say men, as I suppose.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Men, because of their nature, love novelty,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As do birds that men feed in cages.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For though thou take care of them night and day,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And strew their cages with straw fair and soft as silk,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And give them sugar, honey, bread and milk,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Yet just as soon as his door is left open<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He with his feet will kick down his cup,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And to the wood he will go and eat worms;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They are so fond of novelty in their food,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And love novelties because of their nature,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; No nobility of blood can restrain them.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "So fared this falcon, alas the day!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Though he was of noble birth, and fresh and gay,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And goodly to look upon and humble and generous,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He saw upon a time a kite (scavenger bird) fly by,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And suddenly he so loved this kite<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That all his love is completely gone from me,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And has turned his truth false in this manner.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thus has the kite my lover in her service,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And I am lost, without remedy!"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And with that word this falcon did cry out<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And swooned again in Canacee's lap.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Great was the sorrow for the hawk's harm<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That Canacee and all her women made;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They knew not how they might cheer up the falcon.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But Canacee carries her home enfolded in her gown,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And softly did wrap her in bandages,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Where she with her beak had hurt herself.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Now Canacee can do nothing but dig herbs<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Out of the ground, and make new salves<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of herbs, precious and delicate in color,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With which to heal this hawk. From dawn to nighttime<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She devotes her efforts and all her power,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And by her bed's head she made a pen<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And covered it with velvet cloths, blue<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As a sign of truth that is in women seen.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And on all the outside, the pen is painted green,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In which were painted all these false fowls,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Such as are these small birds, falcons, and owls;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For sheer scorn were painted beside them,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Magpies, to cry out against them and chide them.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thus I leave Canacee keeping her hawk;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I will for now speak no more of her ring<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Until it becomes again appropriate to tell<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; How this falcon got back her love,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Repentant, as the story tells us,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; By the mediation of Cambalus,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The king's son, of whom I told you.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But henceforth I will keep to my narrative<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To speak of adventures and of battles<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That never yet were heard such great marvels.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; First will I tell you of Cambyuskan,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That in his time many a city won;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And after I will speak of Algarsif,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; How he won Theodora to his wife,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For whom full often in great peril he was,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Had he not been helped by the steed of brass;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And next I will speak of Cambalo,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That fought in lists with the brethren two<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For Canacee ere he could win her.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And where I left off I will again begin.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; [The second part ends.] <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; [The third part follows.] 
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Appollo whirls up his chariot so high<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To that house of the god Mercury, the sly --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "In faith, Squire, thou hast well acquitted thyself.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And nobly. I praise well thy intelligence,"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Said the Franklin, "considering thy youth,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With such feeling thou speakest, sir, I praise thee!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In my opinion, there is no one that is here<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That shall be thy equal in eloquence,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If thou live; God give thee good luck,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And in virtue send thee perseverance,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For I take great pleasure in thy speech.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I have a son, and by the Trinity,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I had rather than have twenty pound's worth of land,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Though it right now were fallen in my hand,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That he were a man of such discretion<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As you are! Fie on possessions,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Unless a man is virtuous as well!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I have rebuked my son, and shall again,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Because he has no desire to devote himself to virtue;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But to play at dice, and to spend<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And lose all that he has is his usage.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And he would rather talk with a serving boy<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Than converse with any noble person<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; From whom he might learn true nobility."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Straw for your nobility!" said our Host.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "What, Franklin! By God, sir, well thou knowest<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That each of you must tell at the least<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A tale or two, or break his promise."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "That know I well, sir," said the Franklin.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "I pray you, hold me not in disdain,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Though to this man I speak a word or two."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Tell on thy tale without more words."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Gladly, sir Host," said he, "I will obey<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Unto your will; now hearken what I say.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I will not offend you in any way<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So far as my mental abilities will suffice.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I pray to God that it may please you;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Then I will know well that it is good enough."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Cook of London, while the Reeve spoke,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Was so happy he thought the Reeve scratched him on the back.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Ha! ha!" said he, "For Christ's passion,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This miller had a sharp conclusion<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To his logical argument about lodging!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Well said Salomon in his language,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; `Do not bring every man into thy house,'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For providing lodging by night is perilous.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Well ought a man to take heed<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Whom he brings into his private home.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I pray to God, give me sorrow and care<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If ever, since I was called Roger of Ware,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I heard a miller better set to work (tricked).<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He had a malicious trick played on him in the dark.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But God forbid that we stop here;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And therefore, if you agree to hear<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A tale by me, who am a poor man,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I will tell you, as well as ever I can,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A little amusing affair that happened in our city."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Our Host answered and said, "I grant it to thee.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Now tell on, Roger; look that it be good,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For of many a pastry hast thou drawn out the gravy,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And many a Jack of Dover (a kind of pie) hast thou sold<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That has been twice hot and twice cold.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of many a pilgrim hast thou Christ's curse,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For of thy parsley yet they fare the worse,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Which they have eaten with thy stubble-fed goose,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For in thy shop is many a fly loose.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Now tell on, gentle Roger by thy name.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But yet I pray thee, be not angry about a joke;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A man may speak very truthfully in joking and play."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Thou sayest the truth," said Roger, "by my faith!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But `a true jest is a bad jest,' as the Fleming says.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And therefore, Harry Bailly, by thy faith,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Be thou not angry, ere we depart here,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Even though my tale is of an inn-keeper.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But nonetheless I will not tell it yet;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But before we part, indeed, thou shalt be repaid."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And with that he laughed and made good cheer,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And told his tale, as you shall next hear. <BR><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A apprentice once dwelt in our city,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And of a craft of food merchants was he.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Gaily dressed he was as is a goldfinch in the woods,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Brown as a berry, a good-looking short fellow,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With locks black, combed full elegantly.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He could dance so well and jollily<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That he was called Perkin Reveler.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He was as full of love and womanizing<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As is the hive full of honey sweet;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Happy was the wench who with him might meet.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; At every wedding party he would sing and dance;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He loved the tavern better than the shop.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For when there was any procession in Cheapside,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Out of the shop thither would he leap --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Until that he had all the sight seen,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And danced well, he would not come back--<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And gathered him a company of his sort<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To dance and sing and make such merriment;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And there they agreed on a time to meet,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To play at dice in such and such a street.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For in the town there was no apprentice<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That could better throw a pair of dice<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Than Perkin could, and thereto he was free<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In his spending, in a private place.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That found his master easily in his business accounts,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For many times he found his cash box completely bare.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For surely (in the case of) an revelling apprentice<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who makes a practice of dicing, debauchery, or womanizing,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His master shall pay for it in his shop,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Even though he has no share of the entertainment (for which he pays).<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For theft and debauchery, they are interchangeable.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Even though he knows how to play on guitar or fiddle.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Revelling and honesty, in one of low degree,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Are always incompatible, as anyone can see.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This jolly apprentice with his master remained,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Until he was nearly out of his apprenticeship,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Although he was rebuked both early and late,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And sometimes taken (as a prisoner) with music to Newgate prison.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But at the last his master remembered,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Upon a day, when Perkin sought his certificate of release,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A proverb that says this same word:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Well better is a rotten apple out of the store<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Than that it rot al the remnant."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So fares it with a debauched servant;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It is much less harm to let him go away,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Than that he should ruin all the servants in the place.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Therefore his master gave him his certificate,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And ordered him to go, with sorrow and with bad luck!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And thus this jolly apprentice had his leave.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Now let him revel all the night or leave off (do as he chooses).<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And because there is no thief without an accomplice,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who helps him to waste and to consume<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That which he can steal or may borrow,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Right away he sent his bed and his clothing<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Unto a companion of his own sort,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who loved dicing, and revelling, and having fun,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And had a wife that kept for the sake of appearances<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A shop, and screwed for her living.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Our Host began to swear as if he was crazy;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Alas!" said he, "by (Christ's) nails and by (His) blood!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This was a false churl and a false judge.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As shameful a death as heart can devise<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Come to these judges and their advocates!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; At any rate, this innocent maid is slain, alas!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Alas, too dearly she paid for her beauty!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Therefore I say that every day men may see<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That gifts of Fortune and of Nature<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Are cause of death to many a creature.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Her beauty was her death, I dare well say.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Alas, so pitifully as she was slain!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of both gifts that I speak of now<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Men have very often more harm than benefit.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But truly, mine own master dear,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This is a pitiful tale to hear.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But nonetheless, pass over; is does not matter.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I pray to God so save thy gentle body,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And also thy vessels for analyzing urine and thy flasks,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thine ipocras, and also thy galiones (<i>medicines</i>),<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And every container full of thy electuaries;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; God bless them, and our lady Saint Mary!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As I may prosper, thou art a proper man,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And like a prelate, by Saint Ronyan!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Said I not well? I can not speak in technical terms;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But well I know thou makes mine heart to grieve so,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That I almost have caught a palpitation of the heart.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; By corpus' bones! unless I have medicine,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or else a draught of fresh and strong ale,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or unless I hear right now a merry tale,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; My heart is lost for pity of this maid.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thou fair friend (rascal), thou Pardoner," he said,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Tell us some mirth or comic tales right away."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "It shall be done," said he, "by Saint Ronyon!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But first," said he, "here at this ale stake (tavern sign)<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I will both drink and eat of a cake."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But right away these gentlefolk began to cry,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Nay, let him tell us of no ribaldry!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Tell us some moral thing, that we may learn<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Some useful knowledge, and then will we gladly hear."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "I agree, indeed," said he, "but I must think<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; About some respectable thing while I drink."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Gentlemen," he said, "in churches when I preach,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I take pains to have a loud voice,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And ring it out as round as goes a belle,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For I know all by rote that I tell.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; My theme is always the same, and ever was --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'Greed is the root of all evil.'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "First I pronounce from whence I come,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And then my papal bulls I show, each and every one.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Our liege lord's seal on my letter of authorization,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I show that first, to protect my body,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So that no man be so bold, neither priest nor clerk,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To hinder me from (doing) Christ's holy work.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And after that then I tell forth my tales;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Indulgences of popes and of cardinals,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of patriarchs and bishops I show,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And in Latin I speak a few words,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With which to add spice to my preaching,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And to stir them to devotion.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Then I show forth my long crystal stones,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Crammed full of rags and of bones --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Relics they are, as suppose they each one.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Then I have mounted in latten (brass-like alloy) a shoulder-bone<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Which was of a holy Jew's sheep.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; `Good men,' I say, `take heed of my words;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If this bone be washed in any well,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If cow, or calf, or sheep, or ox swell<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That any worm has eaten, or worm stung,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Take water of that well and wash its tongue,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And it is whole right away; and furthermore,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of pocks and of scab, and every sore<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Every sheep shall be whole that of this well<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Drinks a draft. Take heed also what I say:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If the householder who owns the beasts<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Will every week, before the cock crows,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Fasting, drink of this well a draft,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As that same holy Jew taught our elders,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His beasts and his possessions shall multiply.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; `And, sirs, it also heals jealousy;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For though a man be fallen in jealous rage,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Have his potage made with this water,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And he shall never more mistrust his wife,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Though he knew the truth of her misdeed,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Although she had taken two or three priests.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; `Here is a mitten also, that you may see.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He that will put his hand in this mitten,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He shall have multiplying of his grain,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When he has sown, be it wheat or oats,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Providing that he offer pennies, or else fourpences.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; `Good men and women, one thing I warn you:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If any person be in this church now<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who has done such horrible sin, that he <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Dare not, for shame, be confessed of it,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or any woman, be she young or old,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who has made her husband cuckold,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Such folk shall have no power nor no grace<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To offer to my relics in this place.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And whoever finds himself out of such blame,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He will come up and offer in God's name,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And I will absolve him by the authority<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Which by papal bull was granted to me.'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "By this trick have I won, year after year,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; An hundred marks since I was pardoner.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I stand like a clerk in my pulpit,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And when the ignorant people are set down,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I preach as you have heard before<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And tell a hundred more false tales.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Then I take pains to stretch forth the neck,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And east and west upon the people I nod,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As does a dove sitting on a barn.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; My hands and my tongue go so quickly<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That it is joy to see my business.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of avarice and of such cursedness<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Is all my preaching, to make them generous<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To give their pennies, and namely unto me.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For my intention is only to make a profit,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And not at all for correction of sin.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I care not a bit, when they are buried,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Though their souls go picking blackberries! <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For certainly, many a sermon<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Comes often times from an evil intention;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Some for pleasure of folk and flattery,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To be advanced by hypocrisy,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And some for vain glory, and some for hate.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For when I dare debate no other ways,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Then I will sting him with my sharp tongue<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In preaching, so that he shall not escape<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To be defamed falsely, if he<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Has trespassed to my brethren or to me.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For though I tell not his proper name,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Men shall well know that it is the same,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; By signs, and by other details.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thus I repay folk who make trouble for us pardoners;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thus I spit out my venom under hue<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of holinesses, to seem holy and true.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "But shortly my intention I will tell:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I preach of nothing but for greed.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Therefore my theme is yet, and ever was,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; `Greed is the root of all evil.'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thus I can preach against that same vice<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Which I use, and that is avarice.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But though myself be guilty of that sin,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Yet I can make other folk to turn away<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; From avarice and bitterly to repent.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But that is not my principal intention;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I preach nothing but for greed.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Concerning this matter this ought to be enough.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Then I tell them illustrative tales many a one<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of old stories from long time ago.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For ignorant people love old tales;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Such things they can well repeat and hold in memory. <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What, do you suppose, that while I can preach,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And win gold and silver because I teach,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That I will live in poverty voluntarily?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Nay, nay, I never thought it, truly!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For I will preach and beg in various lands;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I will not do any labor with my hands,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Nor make baskets and live thereby,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Because I will not beg idly.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I will imitate none of the apostles;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I will have money, wool, cheese, and wheat,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Although it were given by the poorest servant boy,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or by the poorest widow in a village,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Even though her children should die of hunger.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Nay, I will drink liquor of the vine<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And have a pretty wench in every town.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But listen, gentlemen, in conclusion:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Your desire is that I shall tell a tale.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Now I have drunk a draft of strong ale,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; By God, I hope I shall tell you a thing<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That shall, for good reason, be to your liking.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For though myself be a very vicious man,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Yet I can tell you a moral tale,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Which I am accustomed to preach in order to profit.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Now hold your peace! My tale I will begin."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In Flanders once was a company<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of young folk who practiced folly,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Such as debauchery, gambling, brothels, and taverns,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Where with harps, lutes, and guitars,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They dance and play at dice both day and night,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And also eat and drink beyond their capacity,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Through which they do the devil sacrifice<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Within that devil's temple in cursed manner<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; By abominable excess.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Their oaths are so great and so damnable<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That it is grisly to hear them swear.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Our blessed Lord's body they tore in pieces --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They thought that the Jews did not tear him enough --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And each of them laughed at the other's sin.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And right away then come dancing girls<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Elegantly shaped and slim, and girls selling fruits,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Singers with harps, bawds, girls selling wafers,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Which are the very devil's officers<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To kindle and blow the fire of lechery,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That is joined unto gluttony.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Bible I take as my witness<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That lechery is in wine and drunkenness.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Lo, how that drunken Lot, unnaturally,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Lay by his two daughters, unwittingly;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So drunk he was, he knew not what he did.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Herod, whoever should seek well the histories (would learn),<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When he was filled with wine at his feast,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Right at his own table he gave his command<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To slay John the Baptist, full guiltless.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Seneca says a good word, doubtless;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He says he can find no difference <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Between a man that is out of his mind<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And a man that is drunk,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Except that madness, fallen in an evil person,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Lasts longer than does drunkenness.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; O gluttony, full of cursedness!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; O first cause of our ruin!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; O origin of our damnation,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Until Christ had bought us with his blood again!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Lo, how dearly, shortly to say,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Was bought that same cursed villainy!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Corrupt was all this world for gluttony.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Adam our fader, and his wife also,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; From Paradise to labor and to woe<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Were driven for that vice, there is no doubt.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For while Adam fasted, as I read,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He was in Paradise; and when he<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Ate of the forbidden fruit on the tree,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Immediately he was cast out to woe and pain.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; O gluttony, on thee well we ought to complain!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; O, if a man knew how many evils<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Follow of excess and of gluttony,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He would be the more moderate<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of his diet, sitting at his table.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Alas, the short throat, the tender mouth,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Makes that east and west and north and south,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In earth, in air, in water, men work<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To get a glutton dainty food and drink!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of this matter, O Paul, well can thou treat<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Food unto belly, and belly also unto food,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; God shall destroy both," as Paul says.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Alas, a foul thing it is, by my faith,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To say this word, and fouler is the deed,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When man so drinks of the white and red<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That he makes his privy of his throat <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Through that same cursed excess.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The apostle weeping says full piteously,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "There walk many of whom I have told you --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I say it now weeping, with piteous voice --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They are enemies of Christ's cross,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of which the end is death; belly is their god!"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; O gut! O belly! O stinking bag,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Filled with dung and with corruption!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; At either end of thee the sound is foul.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; How great labor and cost it is to feed thee!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; These cooks, how they pound, and strain, and grind,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And turn substance into outward appearance<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To fulfill all thy gluttonous desire!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Out of the hard bones they knock <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The marrow, for they throw nothing away<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That may go through the gullet softly and sweetly.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of seasonings of leaf, and bark, and root<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Shall his sauce be made for delight,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To make him yet a newer appetite.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But, certainly, he who habitually seeks such delicacies<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Is dead, while he lives in those vices.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A lecherous thing is wine, and drunkenness<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Is full of striving and of wretchedness.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; O drunken man, disfigured is thy face,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Sour is thy breath, foul art thou to embrace,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And through thy drunken nose the sound seems <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As though thou said always "Sampson, Sampson!"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And yet, God knows, Sampson never drank any wine.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thou fallest like a stuck pig;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thy tongue is lost, and all thy care for decency,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For drunkenness is truly the sepulcher<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of man's wit and his discretion.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In whom drink has domination<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He can keep no secrets; there is no doubt.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Now guard yourself from the white and from the red,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And namely from the white wine of Lepe<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That is for sale in Fishstreet or in Cheapside.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This wine of Spain creeps subtly<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Into other wines, growing near by,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of which there rise such bodily vapors<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That when a man has drunk three drafts,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And supposes that he is at home in Cheapside,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He is in Spain, right at the town of Lepe --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Not at La Rochelle, nor at Bordeaux town --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And then will he say "Sampson, Sampson!"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But listen, gentlemen, one word, I pray you,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That all the great deeds, I dare say,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of victories in the Old Testament,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Through true God, who is omnipotent,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Were done in abstinence and in prayer.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Look in the Bible, and there you can learn it.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Consider how Attila, the great conqueror,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Died in his sleep, with shame and dishonor,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Bleeding ever at his nose in drunkenness.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A captain should live in sobriety.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And beyond all this, consider right well<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What was commanded unto Lamuel --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Not Samuel, but Lamuel, I say;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Read the Bible, and find it explicitly<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; About giving wine to those that have the duty of doing justice.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; No more of this, for it may well suffice.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And now that I have spoken of gluttony,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Now I will forbid you gambling.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Dicing is the true mother of lies,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And of deceit, and cursed perjuries,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Blasphemy of Christ, manslaughter, and waste also<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of possessions and of time; and furthermore,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It is a disgrace and contrary to honor<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To be considered a common dice player.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And ever the higher he is of estate,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The more is he considered abandoned (to shame).<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If a prince plays at dicing,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In all governance and policy<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He is, by common opinion,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Held the less in reputation.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Stilboun, who was a wise ambassador,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Was sent to Corinth in very great honor<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; From Sparta to make their alliance.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And when he came, it happened, by chance,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That all the greatest men that were of that land,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Playing at dice he found them.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For which, as soon as it could be,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He stole home again to his country,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And said, "There I will not lose my reputation,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Nor will I take on me so great infamy,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To ally you unto any dice-players.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Send other wise ambassadors;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For, by my troth, I would rather die<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Than I should ally you to dice-players.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For you, that are so glorious in honors,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Shall not ally yourselves with dice-players<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; By my will, nor by my negotiation."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This wise philosopher, thus said he.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Consider also that to the king Demetrius<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The king of Parthia, as the book tells us,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Sent him a pair of dice of gold in scorn,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Because he had played at dicing before that;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For which he held his glory or his renown<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; At no value or esteem.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Lords may find other sorts of play<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Respectable enough to pass the time.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Now will I speak of oaths false and great<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A word or two, as old books treat them.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Great swearing is an abominable thing,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And false swearing is yet more worthy of reproof.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The high God forbad swearing at al,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Witness on Matthew; but in special<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of swearing says the holy Jeremiah,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Thou shall swear truly thine oaths, and not lie,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And in judgement and also in righteousness";<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But idle swearing is a cursed thing.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Behold and see that in the first three<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of high God's honorable commandments,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; How the second of his commands is this:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Take not my name in vain nor amiss."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Lo, he forbids such swearing rather<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Than homicide or many a cursed thing;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I say that, so far as order is concerned, thus it stands;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He who understands his commandments knows this,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; How that is the second command of God.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And furthermore, I will tell thee flatly<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That vengeance shall not part from his house<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who of his oaths is too excessive.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "By God's precious heart," and "By his nails,"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And "By the blood of Christ that is in Hales Abbey,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Seven is my number, and thine is five and three!"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "By God's arms, if thou falsely play,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This dagger shall go throughout thy heart!" --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This fruit comes of the two cursed dice,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Perjury, anger, falseness, homicide.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Now, for the love of Christ, who for us died,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Leave your oaths, both great and small.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But, sirs, now will I tell forth my tale.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; These three rioters of whom I tell,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Long before prime rang of any bell,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Had set themselves in a tavern to drink,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And as they sat, they heard a bell clink<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Before a corpse, which was carried to its grave.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The one of them did call to his servant:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Go quickly," he said, "and ask at once<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What corpse is this that passes by here;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And see that thou report his name correctly."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Sir," said this boy, "that is not at all necessary;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It was told me two hours before you came here.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He was, indeed, an old fellow of yours,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And suddenly he was slain last night,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Completely drunk, as he sat on his bench upright.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There came a stealthy thief men call Death,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who slays all the people in this country,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And with his spear he struck his heart in two,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And went his way without more words.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He has slain a thousand (during) this pestilence.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And, master, before you come in his presence,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It seems to me that it would be necessary<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To beware of such an adversary.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Always be ready to meet him;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thus taught me my mother; I say no more."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "By Saint Mary!" said this tavern-keeper,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "The child says truth, for he has slain this year,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Over a mile from here, within a great village,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Both man and woman, child, and laborer, and servant boy;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I suppose his habitation is there.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It would be great wisdom to be forewarned,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Before he did a man any harm."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Yea, God's arms!" said this rioter,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Is it such peril to meet with him?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I shall seek him by path-way and also by street (everywhere),<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I make a vow to God's honorable bones!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Listen, fellows, we three are all agreed;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Let each of us hold up his hand to other,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And each of us become the others' brother,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And we will slay this false traitor Death.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He shall be slain, he who slays so many,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; By God's dignity, before it be night!"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Together have these three pledged their troths<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To live and die each of them for other,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As though he were his own born brother.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And up they leaped, all drunken in this rage,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And forth they go towards that village<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of which the tavern-keeper had spoken before.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And many a grisly oath then have they sworn,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And Christ's blessed body they tore to pieces --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Death shall be dead, if they can catch him!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When they have gone not fully half a mile,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Right as they would have stepped over a fence,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; An old and poor man met with them.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This old man full meekly greeted them,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And said thus, "Now, lords, may God look after you!"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The proudest of these three rioters<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Answered in reply, "What, churl, bad luck to you!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Why art thou all wrapped up except for thy face?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Why live thou so long in such old age?"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This old man did look in his face,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And said thus: "Because I can not find<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A man, though I walked to India,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Neither in city nor in any village,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That would change his youth for my age;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And therefore I must have my age still,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As long a time as it is God's will.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Nor Death, alas, will not have my life.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thus I walk, like a restless wretch,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And on the ground, which is my mother's gate,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I knock with my staff, both early and late,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And say `Dear mother, let me in!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Lo how I waste away, flesh, and blood, and skin!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Alas, when shall my bones be at rest?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Mother, with you would I exchange my strongbox<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That in my chamber long time has been,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Yea, for an hair shirt to wrap me!'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But yet to me she will not do that favor,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For which full pale and withered is my face.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "But, sirs, to you it is no courtesy<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To speak rudeness to an old man,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Unless he trespass in word or else in deed.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In Holy Writ you may yourself well read:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; `In the presence of an old man, gray upon his head,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You should rise;' therefore I give you advice,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Do no harm now unto an old man,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; No more than you would want men to do to you<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In old age, if you live so long.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And God be with you, wherever you walk or ride!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I must go thither where I have to go."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Nay, old churl, by God, thou shall not so,"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Said this other dice-player quickly;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Thou depart not so quickly, by Saint John!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thou spoke right now of that same traitor Death.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That slays all our friends in this country.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Have here my pledge, as thou art his spy,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Tell where he is or thou shall pay for it,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; By God and by the holy sacrament!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For truly thou art in league with him<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To slay us young folk, thou false thief!"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Now, sirs," said he, "if you are so eager<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To find Death, turn up this crooked way,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For in that grove I left him, by my faith,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Under a tree, and there he will wait;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He will not in any way hide himself because of your boast.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Do you see that oak? Right there you shall find him.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; God save you, He who redeemed mankind,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And amend you!" Thus said this old man;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And every one of these rioters ran<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Until he came to that tree, and there they found<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of fine round florins of coined gold<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Well nigh eight bushels, as they thought.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; No longer then after Death they sought,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But each of them was so glad of that sight,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Because the florins are so faire and bright,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That they set themselves down by this precious hoard.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The worst of them, he spoke the first word.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Brethren," he said, "take heed of what I say;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; My wit is great, though I jest and play.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Fortune has given this treasure unto us <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In mirth and jollity to live our life,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And as easily as it comes, so will we spend it.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Ah, God's precious dignity! Who would have supposed<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To-day that we should have such good fortune?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But if this gold could be carried from this place<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Home to my house, or else unto yours --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For well you know that all this gold is ours --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Then we would be in great happiness.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But truly, it may not be (done) by day.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Men would say that we were arrant thieves,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And for our own treasure have us hanged.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This treasure must be carried by night<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As wisely and as slyly as it can be.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Wherefore I advise that among us all straws<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Be drawn, and let's see where the lot will fall;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And he who has the shortest straw with happy heart <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Shall run to the town, and that very quickly,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And very secretly bring us bread and wine.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And two of us shall carefully guard<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This treasure well; and if he will not tarry,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When it is night, we will carry this treasure,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; By mutual agreement, where we think best."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That one of them brought the straws in his fist,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And commanded them to draw and see where it will fall;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And it fell on the youngest of them all,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And forth toward the town he went right away.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And as soon as he was gone,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The one of them spoke thus unto that other:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Thou knowest well thou art my sworn brother;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thy profit will I tell thee straightway.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thou knowest well that our fellow is gone.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And here is gold, and that a full great quantity,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That shall be divided among us three.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But nevertheless, if I can arrange things so<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That it were divided among us two,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Had I not done a good turn to thee?"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That other answered, "I know not how that can be.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He knows that the gold is with us two;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What shall we do? What shall we say to him?"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Shall it be (our) secret plan?" said the first scoundrel,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "And I shall tell in a few words <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What we shall do, and bring it well about."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "I agree," said that other, "without doubt,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That, by my troth, I will not betray thee."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Now," said the first, "thou knowest well we are two,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And two of us shall be stronger than one.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Look, when he has set down, right away <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Arise as though thou would with him play,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And I shall stab him through the two sides <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; While thou struggle with him as in game,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And with thy dagger see that thou do the same;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And then shall all this gold be divided,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; My dear friend, between me and thee.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Then we both can fulfill all our desires,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And play at dice just as we wish,"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And thus these two scoundrels are agreed<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To slay the third, as you have heard me say.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This youngest, who went to the town,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Very often in heart he rolls up and down<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The beauty of these florins new and bright.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "O Lord!" he said, "if it would be that I might<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Have all this treasure to myself alone,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There is no man that lives under the throne<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of God that should live so merrily as I!"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And at the last the fiend, our enemy,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Put in his thought that he should buy poison,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With which he might slay his two fellows;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Because the fiend found him in such a manner of living<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That he had leave bring him to sorrow.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For this was utterly his full intention,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To slay them both and never to repent.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And forth he goes, no longer would he tarry,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Into the town, unto an apothecary,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And prayed him that he would sell him <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Some poison, that he might kill his rats;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And also there was a polecat in his yard,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That, as he said, had slain his capons,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And he would gladly revenge himself, if he could,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; On vermin that ruined him by night.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The apothecary answered, "And thou shall have<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A thing that, as God may save my soul,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In all this world there is no creature<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That has eaten or drunk of this concoction<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Only so much as the amount of a seed of wheat,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That he shall not immediately lose his life;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Yea, he shall die, and that in less time<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Than thou will go at a walk but only a mile,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This poison is so strong and violent."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This cursed man has in his hand taken <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This poison in a box, and then he ran<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Into the next street unto a man,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And borrowed [of] him three large bottles,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And in the two he poured his poison;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The third he kept clean for his drink.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For all the night he intended to work<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In carrying of the gold out of that place.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And when this rioter, bad luck to him,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Had filled his three big bottles with wine,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He goes back again to his fellows.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What needs it to preach of it more?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For right as they had planned his death before,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Right so they have him slain, and that immediately.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And when this was done, thus spoke that one:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Now let us sit and drink, and make us merry,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And afterward we will bury his body."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And with that word it happened to him, by chance,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To take the bottle where the poison was,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And drank, and gave his fellow drink also,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For which straightway they died, both of the two.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But certainly, I suppose that Avicenna<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Wrote never in any authoritative book, nor in any chapter,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; More wondrous symptoms of poisoning<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Than had these two wretches, before their ending.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thus ended are these two homicides,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And also the false poisoner as well.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; O cursed sin of all cursedness!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; O treacherous homicide, O wickedness!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; O gluttony, lechery, and dicing!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thou blasphemer of Christ with churlish speech<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And great oaths, out of habit and out of pride!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Alas, mankind, how may it happen<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That to thy creator, who made thee<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And with his precious heart's blood redeemed thee,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thou art so false and so unnatural, alas?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Now, good men, God forgive you your trespass,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And guard yourselves from the sin of avarice!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; My holy pardon can cure you all,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Providing that you offer gold coins or silver pennies,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or else silver brooches, spoons, rings.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Bow your head under this holy papal bull!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Come up, you wives, offer some of your wool!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Your names I enter here in my roll immediately;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Into the bliss of heaven you shall go.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I absolve you, by my high power,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You who will offer, as clean and also as clear (of sin)<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As you were born. -- And lo, sirs, thus I preach.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And Jesus Christ, that is our souls' physician,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So grant you to receive his pardon,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For that is best; I will not deceive you.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But, sirs, one word I forgot in my tale:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I have relics and pardons in my bag,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As fine as any man in England,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Which were given to me by the pope's hand.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If any of you will, of devotion,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Offer and have my absolution,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Come forth straightway, and kneel down here,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And meekly receive my pardon;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or else take pardon as you travel,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; All new and fresh at every mile's end,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Providing that you offer, again and again,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Gold coins or silver pennies, which are good and true.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It is an honor to every one that is here<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That you may have a pardoner with sufficient power<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To absolve you in the countryside as you ride,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For accidents that may happen.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Perhaps there may fall one or two<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Down off his horse and break his neck in two.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Look what a safeguard is it to you all<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That I happen to be in your fellowship,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who can absolve you, both more and less (every one),<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When the soul shall from the body pass.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I advise that our Host here shall begin,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For he is most enveloped in sin.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Come forth, sir Host, and offer first right now,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And thou shall kiss the relics every one,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Yea, for a fourpence coin! Unbuckle thy purse right now."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Nay, nay!" he said, "then I will have Christ's curse!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Let it be," he said, "it shall not be, as I may prosper!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thou would make me kiss thine old underpants,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And swear it was a relic of a saint,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Though it were stained by thy fundament!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But, by the cross that Saint Helen found,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I would I had thy testicles in my hand<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Instead of relics or a container for relics.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Have them cut off, I will help thee carry them;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They shall be enshrined in a hog's turd!"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This Pardoner answered not a word;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So angry he was, no word would he say.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Now," said our Host, "I will no longer joke<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With thee, nor with any other angry man."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But immediately the worthy Knight began,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When he saw that all the people laughed,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "No more of this, for it is right enough!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Sir Pardoner, be glad and merry of cheer;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And you, sir Host, who are so dear to me,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I pray you that you kiss the Pardoner.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And Pardoner, I pray thee, draw thyself nearer,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And, as we did, let us laugh and play."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; At once they kissed, and rode forth their way.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When folk had laughed at this foolish business<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of Absolon and clever Nicholas,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Different folk said different opinions,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But for the most part they laughed and enjoyed themselves.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And at this tale I saw no man aggrieved,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Except for only Osewold the Reeve.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Because he was of the carpenter's craft,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A little anger is left in his heart;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He began to grouch, and criticized it a little.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "As I may prosper," said he, "very well could I repay thee<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With (a tale of the) blearing of a proud miller's eye (tricking him),<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If I wanted to speak of ribaldry.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But I am old; because of age I do not want to play;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Grass time is done; my fodder is now dry straw;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This white head reveals my old years;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; My heart is as moldy as my hairs,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Unless I fare as does the fruit of the medlar --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That same fruit continually grows worse,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Until it is rotten in rubbish or in straw.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We old men, I fear, fare like that:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Until we are rotten, we can not be ripe;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We dance always while the world will pipe.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For in our will there sticks ever a nail,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To have a white head and a green tail,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As a leek has; for though our power is gone,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Our will desires folly continually.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For when we can not do anything, then will we talk about it;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Yet in our old ashes fire is raked over (covered).<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Four live coals have we, which I shall describe --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Boasting, lying, anger, greed;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; These four little sparks belong to old age.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Our old limbs may well be feeble,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But desire shall not be lacking, that is truth.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And yet I have always a young man's desires,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As many years as have passed hence<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Since my tap of life began to run.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For surely, when I was born, immediately<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Death turned on the spigot of life and let it flow,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And ever since the tap has so run<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Until the barrel is almost all empty.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The stream of life now drops on the rim.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The foolish tongue may well ring and chime<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; About wretchedness that passed long ago;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With old folk, save dotage, there is no more!"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When our Host had heard this sermon making,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He began to speak as lordly as a king.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He said, "What amounts all this wit?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What! shall we speak all day of holy writ?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The devil made a reeve to preach,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or of a cobbler made a shipman or a physician.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Say forth thy tale, and do not waste the time.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Lo Deptford, and it is almost seven thirty!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Lo Greenwich, in which is many a rascal!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It is well time to begin thy tale."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Now, sires," said this Osewold the Reeve,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "I pray yow all that you not be displeased,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Though I answer (him), and somewhat make a fool of him; <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For it is permissable to repel force with force.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "This drunk Miller has told us here<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; How a carpenter was tricked,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Perhaps in scorn, for I am one.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And, by your leave, I shall repay him right now;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Right in his churl's terms will I speak.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I pray to God his neck may break into pieces;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He can well in my eye see a piece of straw,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But in his own he can not see a large piece of timber."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; At Trumpington, not far from Cambridge,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There goes a brook, and over that a bridge,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Upon the which brook there stands a mill;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And this is absolute truth that I tell you:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A miller was there dwelling many a day.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As any peacock he was proud and gay.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He could play the bagpipe and fish, and mend nets,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And play a drinking game, and well wrestle and shoot;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Always by his belt he carried a long cutlass,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And very sharp was the blade of the sword.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; An elegant dagger he carried in his pouch;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There was no man, for peril, dared touch him.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A Sheffield knife he carried in his hose.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Round was his face, and he had a pug nose;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As bald as an ape was his skull.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He was a quarrelsome bully in every way.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There dared no person lay hand upon him,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That he did not swear he should pay for it right away.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A thief he was, in truth, of grain and meal,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And that a sly one, and accustomed to steal.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His name was called haughty Symkyn.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A wife he had, come of noble kin;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The parson of the town was her father.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With her he gave very many a pan of brass,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So that Symkyn should be allied with his family.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She was fostered in a nunnery;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For Symkyn would have no wife, as he said,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Unless she were well educated and a virgin,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To preserve his state of yeomanry.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And she was proud, and brazen as is a magpie.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A very fair sight was it to look upon those two;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; On holidays before her would he go<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With the tip of his hood wound about his head,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And she came after in a gown of red;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And Symkyn had hose of the same color.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There dared no one call her anything but "lady";<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There was no one so brave that went by the way<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That dared flirt with her or once play,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Unless he wished to be slain by Symkyn<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With cutlass, or with knife, or dagger.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For jealous folk are dangerous always --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; At least they would like their wives to think so.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And also, because she was a bit besmirched (by her illegitimacy),<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She was as haughty as water in a ditch,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And full of disdain and of scorn.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She thought that a lady should be aloof,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Considering her family and her education<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Which she had learned in the nunnery.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A daughter had they between them two<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of twenty years of age, without any more,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Except for a child that was a half year of age;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In cradle it lay and was a good looking little boy.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This wench was thick and well grown,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With pug nose and eyes gray as glass,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With buttocks broad and breasts round and high.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But right fair was her hair; I will not lie.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This parson of the town, because she was fair,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Was determined to make her his heir,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Both of his property and his household,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And he raised difficulties about her marriage.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His purpose was to bestow her high<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Into some worthy family of noble ancestry;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For holy church's goods must be dispensed<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To holy church's blood, which is descended from the church.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Therefore he would his holy blood honor,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Though he holy church should devour.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A profitable monopoly on milling has this miller, out of doubt,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With wheat and malt of all the land about;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And namely there was an important college<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; People call the Soler Hall at Cambridge;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There their wheat and also their malt was ground.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And on one day it happened, at a time,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The manciple lay sick with a malady;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; People thought indeed that he should die.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For which this miller stole both meal and grain<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A hundred times more than before;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For before this he stole but courteously,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But now he was a thief excessively,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For which the warden (of the college) complained and made a fuss.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But the miller thought that not worth a weed;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He blustered fiercely, and swore it was not so.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Then were there two young poor scholars,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who dwelt in this hall, of which I tell.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Headstrong they were, and eager for sport,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And, only for their mirth and amusement,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Upon the warden busily they implore<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To give them leave, for but a little while,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To go to the mill and see their grain ground;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And boldly they dared pledge their necks<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The miller should not steal from them half a peck<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of grain by trickery, nor rob them by force;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And at the last the warden gave hem leave.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; John was called that one, and Aleyn was called that other;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of one town were they born, that was called Strother,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Far in the north; I can not tell where.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This Aleyn makes ready all his gear,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And on a horse the sack he cast immediately.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Forth goes Aleyn the clerk, and also John,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With good sword and with buckler by their sides.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; John knew the way -- they needed no guide --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And at the mill he lays the sack down.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Aleyn spoke first: "All hail, Symond, in faith!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; How fares thy faire daughter and thy wife?"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Aleyn, welcome," said Symkyn, "by my life!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And John also, how now, what do you here?"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Symond," said John, "by God, need knows no law.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He who has no servant must serve himself,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or else he is a fool, as clerks say.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Our manciple, I expect he will be dead,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So continually ache the teeth in his head;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And therefore I am come, and also Alayn,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To grind our grain and carry it home again;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I pray you speed us hence as fast as you can."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "It shall be done," said Symkyn, "by my faith!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What will you do while it is being done?"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "By God, right by the hopper will I stand,"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Said John, "and see how the grain goes in.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Yet saw I never, by my father's kin,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; How the hopper wags to and fro."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Aleyn answered, "John, and wilt thou do so?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Then will I be beneath, by my head,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And see how the meal falls down<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Into the trough; that shall be my sport.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For John, in faith, I may be like you;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I am as poor a miller as you are."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This miller smiled at their foolishness,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And thought, "All this is done only for a trick.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They think that no man can trick them,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But by my welfare, yet shall I blear their eyes (fool them),<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Despite all the trickery in their philosophy.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The more ingenious tricks that they make,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The more will I steal when I take.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Instead of flour yet will I give them bran.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; `The greatest clerks are not the wisest men,'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As once to the wolf thus spoke the mare.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; All their learning I reckon not worth a weed."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Out at the door he goes full stealthily,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When he saw his time, quietly.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He looks up and down until he has found<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The clerks' horse, where it stood tied<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Behind the mill, under an arbor;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And to the horse he goes gently; <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He strips off the bridle right away.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And when the horse was loose, he begins to go<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Toward the fen, where wild mares run,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And forth with "wehee," through thick and through thin.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This miller goes back to the mill, no word he said,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But does his work, and with the clerks amused himself<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Until their grain was completely ground.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And when the meal is sacked and tied,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This John goes out and finds his horse gone away,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And began to cry "Help!" and "Wellaway!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Our horse is lost, Alayn, for God's bones,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Step on thy feet! Come on, man, quickly!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Alas, our warden has lost his saddle horse."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This Aleyn forgot everything, both meal and grain;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; All his skillful management was out of his mind.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "What, which way is he gone?" he began to cry.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The wife cam leaping inward at a run.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She said, "Alas! your horse goes to the fen<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With wild mares, as fast as he can go.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Curses come on his hand that tied him so carelessly,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And he that should have tied the rein better!"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Alas," said John, "Aleyn, for Christ's pain<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Lay down thy sword, and I will mine also.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I am full strong (swift), God knows, as is a roe deer;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; By God's heart, he shall not escape us both!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Why did thou not put the horse in the barn?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Bad luck! By God, Alayn, thou art a fool!"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; These hapless clerks have run very fast <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Toward the fen, both Aleyn and also John.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And when the miller saw that they were gone,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He half a bushel of their flour has taken,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And ordered his wife to go knead it in a cake.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He said, "I suppose the clerks were leery (of what I might do).<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Yet can a miller make a clerk's beard (trick a clerk),<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Despite all his learning; now let them go their way!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Lo, there he goes! Yes, let the children play.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They will not catch him easily, by my crown."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; These hapless clerks run up and down<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With "Stop! Stop! Stand! Stand! Down there, watch out behind,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Go whistle thou, and I shall catch him here!"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But shortly, until that it was truly night,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They could not, though they did al their might,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Catch their horse, he ran always so fast,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Until in a ditch they caught him at the last.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Weary and wet, as a beast is in the rain,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Comes hapless John, and with him comes Aleyn.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Alas," said John, "the day that I was born!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Now are we driven to contempt and to scorn.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Our grain is stolen; men will call us fools,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Both the warden and all our fellows,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And namely the miller, wellaway!"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thus laments John as he goes by the way<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Toward the mill, and the horse Bayard in his hand.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The miller sitting by the fire he found,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For it was night, and further they could not go;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But for the love of God they ask him  <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For lodging and for refreshment, for their cash.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The miller said in reply, "If there be any,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Such as it is, yet shall you have your share.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; My house is small, but you have learned the art of logic;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You know how by logical arguments to make a place<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A mile broad out of twenty feet of space.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Let's see now if this place may suffice,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or make it large by speech, as is your custom."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Now, Symond," said John, "by Saint Cuthbert,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thou art always joking, and this is nicely answered.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I have heard said, `Man shall take one of two things:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Such as he finds, or take such as he brings.'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But specially I pray thee, host dear,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Get us some food and drink, and make us good cheer,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And we will pay truly at the full.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With empty hand men may lure no hawks;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Lo, here is our silver, ready to spend."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This miller into town his daughter sent<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For ale and bread, and roasted them a goose,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And tied up their horse, it should no more go loose,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And in his own bedroom made them a bed,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With sheets and with blankets nicely spread<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Not ten feet or twelve from his own bed.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His daughter had a bed, all by herself,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Right in the same chamber side by side.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It could be no better, and (do you know) the cause why?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There was no larger lodging in the place.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They sup and they converse, to entertain themselves,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And drink ever strong ale of the best quality.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; About midnight they went to bed.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Well has this miller varnished his head (drank heavily);<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Full pale he was for drunkenness, and not red.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He belches, and he speaks through the nose<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As if he had hoarseness, or had a cold.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To bed he goes, and with him goes his wife.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She was as cheerful and jolly as any jay,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So was her jolly whistle well wetted.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The cradle at her bed's feet is set,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To rock, and to give the child to suck.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And when all that was in the crock was drunk,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To bed went the daughter right away;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To bed goes Aleyn and also John;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There was no more -- they needed no sleeping potion.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This miller has imbibed so much ale<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That he snorts like a horse in his sleep,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And of his tail behind he took no heed.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His wife bore him a bass accompaniment, very loud;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; One could hear their snoring two furlongs away;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The wench snores also, to keep them company.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Aleyn the clerk, who heard this melody,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He poked John, and said, "Sleepest thou?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Heardest thou ever such a song before now?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Lo, such a compline (evening service) is made by them all;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; May a wild fire upon their bodies fall!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who heard ever such an amazing thing?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Yes, they shall have the best (i.e., the worst) of a bad ending.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This long night there comes to me no sleep;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But yet, no matter, all shall be for the best.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For, John," said he, "as ever I may thrive,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If I can, yon wench will I screw.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Some redress the law has shaped for us,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For, John, there is a law that says thus:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That if a man in one point is injured,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That in another he shall be relieved.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Our grain is stolen, truly, it can not be denied,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And we have had a hard time all this day;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And since I shall have no recompense<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For my loss, I will have satisfaction.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; By God's soul, it shall be no other way!"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This John answered, "Alayn, be careful!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The miller is a perilous man," he said,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "And if he out of his sleep suddenly awoke,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He might do injury to us both."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Aleyn answered, "I reckon him not worth a fly."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And up he rises, and by the wench he crept.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This wench lay on her back and fast slept,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Until he was so near, before she could see him,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It was too late to cry out,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And shortly to speak, they were together. <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Now play, Aleyn, for I will speak of John.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This John lies still five minutes or so,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And to himself he laments and feels sorry.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Alas!" said he, "this is a wicked trick;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Now may I say that I am nothing but a fool.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Yet has my fellow something for his harm;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He has the miller's daughter in his arm.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He took a risk, and has accomplished his purpose,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And I lie like a sack of rubbish in my bed;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And when this trick is told another day,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I shall be considered a fool, a weakling!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I will arise and chance it, by my faith!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; `The timid one is unlucky,' thus people say."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And up he rose, and quietly he went<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To the cradle, and in his hand seized it,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And carried it quietly to the foot of his bed.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Soon after this the wife stopped her snoring,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And awoke, and went out to piss,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And came back, and began to miss her cradle,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And groped here and there, but she found none.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Alas!" said she, "I had almost gone wrong;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I had almost gone to the clerks' bed.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Ay, bless me! Then I would have made a mess of it!"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And forth she goes until she found the cradle.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She gropes always further with her hand,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And found the bed, and thought all was well,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Because the cradle by it stood,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And did not know where she was, for it was dark;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But gently she crept in to the clerk,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And lies full still, and would have gone to sleep.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Within a moment this John the clerk leaped up,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And on this good wife he lays on vigorously.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She had not had so merry an experience for a long time;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He stabs hard and deep as if he were mad.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This jolly life have these two clerks led<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Until the third cock began to sing (an hour before dawn).<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Aleyn grew weary at the time of dawn,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For he had labored all the long night,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And said, "Farewell, Malyne, sweet creature!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The day is come; I may no longer remain here;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But evermore, wherever I walk or ride,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I am thine own clerk, as I may prosper!"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Now, dear sweetheart," said she, "go, farewell!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But before thou go, one thing I will tell thee:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When thou go homeward by the mill,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Right at the entry behind the door <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thou shalt find a cake of half a bushel<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That was made of thine own meal,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Which I helped my father to steal.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And, good sweetheart, God save and keep thee!"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And with that word she almost began to weep.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Aleyn up rises, and thought, "Before it dawns,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I will go creep in by my fellow,"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And found the cradle with his hand right away.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "By God," thought he, "I have gone all wrong.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; My head is dizzy from my work to-night,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That makes me go not right.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I know well by the cradle I have gone wrong;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Here lies the miller and his wife also."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And forth he goes, in the name of twenty devils,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Unto the bed where the miller lay.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He expected to have crept in by his fellow John,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And in by the miller he crept right then,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And caught him by the neck, and quietly he spoke.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He said, "Thou John, thou pig's-head, awake,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For Christ's soul, and hear a real joke.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For by that lord that is called Saint James,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I have three times in this short night<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Screwed the miller's daughter flat on her back,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; While thou hast, like a coward, been terrified."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Yes, false scoundrel," said the miller, "hast (thou done so)?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Ah, false traitor! False clerk!" said he,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Thou shalt be dead, by God's worthiness!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who dared be so bold to degrade<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; My daughter, who is come from such noble lineage?"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And by the Adam's apple he caught Alayn,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And he seized him angrily in turn,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And on the nose he smote him with his fist.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Down ran the bloody stream upon his breast;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And on the floor, with nose and mouth badly broken,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They wallow as do two pigs in a bag;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And up they go, and down again straightway,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Until the miller stumbled on a stone,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And down he fell backward upon his wife,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who knew nothing of this foolish strife;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For she was fallen asleep a little bit<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With John the clerk, who had been awake all night,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And with the fall out of her sleep she started up.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Help! holy cross of Bromeholm," she said,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "In your hands! Lord, to Thee I call!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Awake, Symond! The fiend has fallen on me.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; My heart is broken; help! I am as good as dead!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There lies one upon my belly and one on my head.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Help, Symkyn, for the false clerks fight!"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This John started up as fast as ever he could,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And grasps by the walls to and fro,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To find a staff; and she leaped up also,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And knew the interior of the house better than did this John,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And by the wall a staff she found right away,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And saw a little glimmering of a light,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For at a hole in shone the moon bright,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And by that light she saw both the two of them,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But surely she did not know who was who,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But she saw a white thing in her eye.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And when she did espy this white thing,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She thought the clerk had worn a night cap,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And with the staff she drew ever nearer and nearer,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And intended to have hit this Aleyn squarely,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And smote the miller on the bald skull,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So that down he goes, and cried, "Help! I die!"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; These clerks beat him well and let him lie,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And dress themselves, and took their horse straightway,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And also their meal, and on their way they go.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And at the mill yet they took their cake<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of half a bushel flour, very well baked.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thus is the proud miller well beaten,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And has lost the charge for grinding of the wheat,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And paid for the supper every bit<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of Aleyn and of John, who beat him well.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His wife is screwed, and his daughter also.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Lo, this is how it is when a miller is false!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And therefore this proverb is said very truly,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "One who does evil should not expect good."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A trickster shall himself be tricked.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And God, that sits high in majesty,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Save al this company, high ranking and low (every one)!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thus have I repaid the Miller in my tale.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The minister and the nurse of vices,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Which men call in English Idleness,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who is porter of the gate of pleasures<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To shun, and by her contrary to overcome her --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That is to say, by keeping busy in lawful good works --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Well ought we to do all our diligence<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Lest the fiend by means of idleness seize us.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For he that with his thousand sly snares<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Continually lies in wait to seize us suddenly,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When he can espy a man in idleness,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He can catch him in his trap so quickly,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That until a man is seized right by the hem of his garment,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He is not aware that the fiend has him in hand.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Well ought we to work and resist idleness.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And even though people never dreaded to die,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Yet they can well see by reason, doubtless,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That idleness is rotten laziness,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; From which there never comes any good or profit;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And since sloth holds her (Idleness) on a leash<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (Allowing her) only to sleep, and to eat and drink,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And to devour all that others earn by working,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And in order to set us apart from such idleness,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Which is the cause of such great ruin,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I have here done my faithful efforts<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In translating the legend <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Correctly of thy glorious life and suffering,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thou with thy garland made with rose and lily --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I mean thee, maid and martyr, Saint Cecilie.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;    <i>Invocacio ad Mariam<BR></i>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (Invocation to Mary)</i></B>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And thou who art the flower of all virgins,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of whom it so well pleased Bernard to write,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To thee at my beginning first I call;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thou comfort of us wretches, let me narrate<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thy maiden's death, that won by means of her merit<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The eternal life and victory over the fiend,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As one may hereafter read in her story.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thou Maid and Mother, daughter of thy Son,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thou well of mercy, sinful souls' cure,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In whom God for goodness chose to dwell,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thou humble, and high over every creature,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thou so greatly enobled our nature,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That the Maker of humankind had no disdain <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To clothe and wrap His Son in blood and flesh.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Within the blissful cloister of thy sides<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The eternal love and peace took man's shape,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He who is lord and guide of the threefold universe,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Whom earth and sea and heaven unceasing <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Ever praise; and thou, Virgin without blemish,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Bore in thy body -- and remained maiden pure --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Creator of every creature.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Magnificence is in thee combined <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With mercy, goodness, and with such pity<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That thou, who art the sun of excellence<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Not only helpest them that pray thee,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But often of thy goodness <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Very willingly, before men beseech thine help,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thou goest before and art their lives' physician.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Now, thou meek and blissful fair maid help<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Me, banished exile, in this desert of bitterness;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Think on the Cananite woman, who said<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That dogs eat some of all the crumbs<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That from their lord's table are fallen;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And though that I, unworthy son of Eve,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Be sinful, yet accept my faith.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And, because faith is dead without works,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Give me wit and opportunity to work so,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That I may be free from that place that is most dark!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; O thou, that art so fair and full of grace,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Be my advocate in that high place<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Where unceasingly is sung "Hosanna,"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thou Christ's mother, daughter dear of Anne!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And of thy light enlighten in prison my soul,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That is troubled by the contamination <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of my body, and also by the weight<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of earthly lust and false desires;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; O haven of refuge, O salvation<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of those who are in sorrow and in distress,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Now help, for to my work I will address myself.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Yet I pray you who read what I write,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Forgive me that I make no effort<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To narrate this same story elaborately,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For I have both the words and the meaning <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of him who out of reverence for the saint<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Wrote the story, and  (I) follow her legend,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And pray you that you will correct (any errors in) my work.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;      <i>Interpretacio nominis Cecile quam ponit Frater<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;        Jacobus Januensis in Legenda<BR></i>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Jacob of Genoa put in the Legend.)<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; First the name of Saint Cecilie I would to you <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Explain, as one can see in her story.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It is to say in English "heaven's lily,"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For pure chastity of virginity;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or, because she had whiteness because of chastity,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And green because of conscience and of good reputation<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The sweet smell, "lily" was her name.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or Cecilie is to mean "the way for the blind,"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Because she set an example by good teaching;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or else Cecile, as I written find,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Is joined, by a sort of combination<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of "heaven" and "Leah"; and here, symbolically,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The "heaven" is set for her holiness of thought,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And "Leah" for her constant business.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Cecile may also be explained in this manner,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Lack of blindness," for her great light<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of wisdom and for her pure morals;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or else, lo, this maidens bright name <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Comes from "heaven" and "leos," for which rightly<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Men could well call her "the heaven of people,"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Exemplar of all good and wise works.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For "leos" in English means "people,"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And just as men may in the heaven see<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The sun and moon and stars in every direction,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Just so in this maiden men spiritually<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; See the greatness of spirit of faith,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And also the complete clarity of wisdom,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And various works, bright because of their excellence.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And just as these scientists write<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That heaven is swift and round and also burning,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Just so was fair Cecilie the white<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Very swift and busy ever in good works,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And round and whole in persevering in good (works),<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And burning ever in very bright charity.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Now have I declared to you what she was called.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  <i> Explicit </i><BR>
&nbsp;  &nbsp;   &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; (Here ends [the Prologue])
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This bright maiden Cecilie, as her Life says,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Was descended from Romans and of noble birth,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And from her cradle nurtured up in the faith<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of Christ, and bore his gospel in her mind.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She never ceased, as I written find,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of her prayer and God to love and dread,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Beseeching him to preserve her virginity.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And when this maiden should unto a man<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Wedded be, who was very young of age,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who was called Valerian,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And the day of her marriage was come,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She, very devout and humble in her spirit,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Under her robe of gold, that became her very well, <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Had next to her flesh clad herself in a hair shirt.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And while the organs made melody,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To God alone in heart thus sang she:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "O Lord, my soul and also my body preserve<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Immaculate, lest that I be damned."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And for his love who died upon the cross<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Every second and third day she fasted,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Ever praying in her prayers very earnestly.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The night came, and to bed must she go<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With her husband, as often is the manner,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And privately to him she said at once,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "O sweet and well beloved spouse dear,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There is a secret, if you want to hear it,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Which I am very eager to say to you,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Providing that you swear you shall not reveal it."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Valerian did earnestly unto her swear<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That for no occasion nor thing that might be,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He should never ever betray her;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And then for the first time to him thus said she:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "I have an angel who loves me,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who with great love, whether I wake or sleep,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Is always ready to guard my body.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "And if he may sense, withoubt doubt,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That you touch me, or love me lecherously,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He straightway will slay you in the act,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And in your youth thus you shall die;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And if you preserve me in chaste love,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He will love you as (he loves) me, for your chastity,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And show you his joy and his brightness."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Valerian, corrected as God would (have it),<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Answered in reply, "If I must trust thee,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Let me see that angel and behold him;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And if it be a true angel,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Then will I do as thou hast prayed me;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And if thou love another man, in truth<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Then truly with this sword will I slay you both."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Cecile answered immediately in this manner:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "If you wish, you shall see the angel,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Provided that you believe in Christ and have yourself baptized.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Go forth to the Appian Way," said she,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "That from this town stands no more than three miles,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And to the poor folks that dwell there,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Say to them exactly thus, which I shall tell you.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Tell them that I, Cecile, sent you to them <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To show you the good Urban the old,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For secret needs and for a good purpose.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And when you have beheld Saint Urban,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Tell him the words which I told to you;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And when he has cleansed you of sin (by baptism),<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Then you shall see that angel, ere you depart."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Valerian has gone to the place,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And just as he was taught by his learning (from Cecilie),<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He immediately found this holy old Urban <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In hiding among the saints' burial places.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And he immediately without delay<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Said his message; and when he told it,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Urban for joy did hold up his hands.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He let the tears fall from his eyes.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Almighty Lord, O Jesus Christ," said he,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Sower of chaste counsel, shepherd of us all,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The fruit of that same seed of chastity<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That thou hast sown in Cecile, take to thee!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Lo, like a busy bee, without guile,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Always thine own servant Cecile serves Thee.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "For that same spouse that she took just now<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Very like a fierce lion, she sends here,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As meek as ever was any lamb, to you!"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And with that word anon there did appear<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; An old man, clad in clear white clothes,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who had in hand a book with lettering of gold ,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And did stand before Valerian.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When he saw him, and the  old man picked him up then,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And from his book right thus he began to read:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "One Lord, one faith, one God, without more,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; One baptism, and Father of all also,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Above all and over all everywhere."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; These words were written all with gold.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When this was read, then said this old man,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Dost thou believe this thing or not? Say yes or no."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "I believe all this thing," said Valerian,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "For truer thing than this, I dare well say,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; No person under the heaven can imagine."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Then vanished this old man, he knew not where,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And Pope Urban christened him right there.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Valerian goes home and finds Cecilie<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Within his room standing with an angel.<BR> 
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This angel had of roses and of lily<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Two crowns, which he bore in hand;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And first to Cecile, as I understand,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He gave that one, and after he did give<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That other to Valerian, her mate.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "With body clean and with unblemished thought<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Always guard well these crowns," said he;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "From paradise I have brought them to you,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Nor never ever shall they be rotten,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Nor lose their sweet fragrance, trust me;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Nor never a person shall see them with his eye,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Unless he be chaste and hates villainy.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "And thou, Valerian, because thou so soon<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Assented to good counsel also,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Say what pleases thee, and thou shalt have thy request."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "I have a brother," said Valerian then,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "And in this world I love no man so much.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I pray you that my brother may have grace<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To know the truth, as I do in this place."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The angel said, "God likes thy request,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And both (of you) with the palm of martyrdom<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You shall come unto his blissful feast."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And with that word Tiburce his brother came.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And when he perceived the fragrance,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Which the roses and the lilies cast forth<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Within his heart he began to wonder intently,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And said, "I wonder, this time of the year,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Whence that sweet fragrance comes so (much)<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of rose and lilies that I smell here.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For even if I had them in my two hands,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The fragrance could go in me no deeper.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The sweet smell that in my heart I find<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Has changed me all into another nature."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Valerian said: "Two crowns have we,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Snow white and rose red, that shine clear,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Which thine eyes have no power to see;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And as thou smellest them because of my prayer,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So shalt thou see them, beloved brother dear,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If it so be thou will, without delaying,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Believe correctly and know real truth."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Tiburce answered, "Sayest thou this to me<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In actuality, or do I hear this in dream?"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "In dreams," said Valerian, "have we been<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Until this time, my brother, indeed.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But now for the first time our dwelling is in truth."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "How knowest thou this?" said Tiburce, "and in what manner?"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Said Valerian, "That I shall tell thee.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "The angel of God has taught me the truth<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Which thou shalt see, if thou wilt renounce<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The idols and be chaste, and otherwise nothing (will you see.)"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And of the miracle of these two crowns<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Saint Ambrose in his preface is pleased to speak;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Solemnly this noble dear Doctor (of the Church)<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Commends it, and says in this manner:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "In order to receive the palm of martyrdom,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Saint Cecile, completely filled with God's gift,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The world and also her bed-chamber did she give up;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Witness Tyburce's and Valerian's confession,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To which God of his goodness would provide<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Two crowns of flowers well smelling,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And made his angel bring them the crowns.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "The maid has brought these men to bliss above;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The world has known what it is worth, certainly,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To love a devotion to chastity."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Then Cecile showed him all open and plain<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That all idols are but meaningless things,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For they are dumb, and moreover they are deaf,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And (she) ordered him to leave his idols.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Whoever believes not this, he is a beast,"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Tiburce then said, "if I shall not lie."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And she who heard this did kiss his breast,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And was very glad he could perceive truth.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "This day I take thee for my kinsman,"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Said this blissful fair maid dear,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And after that she said as you may hear:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Lo, exactly as the love of Christ," said she,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Made me thy brother's wife, exactly in that manner<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Right now here I take thee for my kinsman,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Since thou will despise thine idols.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Go with thy brother now, and get thyself baptized,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And make thyself clean, so that thou can behold<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The angel's face of which thy brother told."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Tiburce answered and said, "Brother dear,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; First tell me where I must go, and to what man?"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "To whom?" said he, "come forth with right good cheer, <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I will lead thee unto the Pope Urban."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "To Urban? My brother Valerian,"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Said then Tiburce, "wilt thou lead me there?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It seems to me that it would be a wonderful deed.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Thou meanest not Urban," said he then,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "That is so often condemned to be dead,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And dwells in hiding places always (going) from one to another, <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And dares not once put forth his head?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Men should burn him in a fire so red<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If he were found, or if men could catch sight of him,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And we too (would burn), to bear him company;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "And while we seek that same divinity<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That is hidden secretly in heaven,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Nevertheless we shall be burned in this world!"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To whom Cecile answered boldly,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Men might well and reasonably fear<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To lose this life, my own dear brother,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If this were the only life and (there were) none other.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "But there is a better life in another place,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That never shall be lost, doubt thee not,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Which God's Son told us by means of his grace. <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That Father's Son has created all things,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And all that is created (and endowed) with the power of reason;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Holy Ghost, who from the Father did proceed,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Has given them souls, without any doubt.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "By word and by miracle high God's Son,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When he was in this world, declared here<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That there was another life where men may dwell."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To whom answered Tiburce, "O sister dear,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Said thou not just now in this manner,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There is but one God, lord in truthfulness?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And now of three how canst thou bear witness?"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "That shall I tell," said she, "ere I go.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Exactly as a man has three mental faculties --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Memory, imagination, and judgement also --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So in one being of divinity,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Three persons may right well be there."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Then very zealously she did preach to him <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of Christ's coming, and teach (him) of His pains,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And many particulars of His passion;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; How God's Son was compelled to remain in this world <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To provide full forgiveness for mankind,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Which was bound in sin and painful cares;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; All this thing she told unto Tiburce.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And after this Tiburce with a good will<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With Valerian he went to Pope Urban,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who thanked God, and with glad and happy heart <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He christened him and made him in that place<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Perfect in his learning, God's knight.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And after this Tiburce got such grace<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That every day in real time and space he saw <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The angel of God; and every manner of gift<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That he asked of God was provided immediately.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It would be very hard in proper sequence to say<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; How many wonders Jesus made for them;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But at the last, to tell short and plain,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The officers of the law of the town of Rome sought them,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And brought them before Almache, the prefect,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who questioned them, and knew all their thought,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And sent them to the image of Jupiter,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And said, "Whoever will not sacrifice,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Strike off his head; this is my sentence here."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Immediately these martyrs of whom I tell you,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; One Maximus, that was an officer<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of the prefect's, and his chief assistant,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Seized them, and when he led forth the saints,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He himself wept for pity that he had.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When Maximus had heard the saints' teaching,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He got himself permission of the executioners, <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And led them to his house without more delay,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And with their preaching, ere that it was evening,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They did take away from the executioners,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And from Maxime, and from his folk each one of them,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The false faith, (and brought them) to believe in God alone.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Cecile came, when it was grown night,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With priests who christened them all together;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And afterward, when day was grown light,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Cecile said to them with a full steadfast countenance,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Now, Christ's own knights beloved and dear,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Cast away all the works of darkness,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And arm yourselves in armor of brightness.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "You have truly done a great battle,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Your race is done, your faith you have maintained.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Go to the crown of life that can not fail;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The rightful Judge, whom you have served,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Shall give it to you, as you have deserved it."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And when this thing was said as I tell,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Men led them forth to do the sacrifice.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But when they were brought to the place <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To tell shortly the conclusion,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They would not incense nor sacrifice in any way,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But on their knees they set themselves down<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With humble heart and steadfast devotion,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And lost both their heads in the place.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Their souls went to the King of grace.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This Maximus, who saw this thing happen,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With piteous tears told it right away,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That he saw their souls glide to heaven <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With angels full of clearness and of light,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And with his word converted many a person;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For which Almachius had him so beaten<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With whip tipped with lead that he left his life.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Cecile took him and buried him straightway<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; By Tiburce and Valerian tenderly<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Within their burying place, under the tombstone;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And after this, Almachius hastily<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Ordered his ministers to fetch publicly <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Cecile, so that she might in his presence<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Do sacrifice and burn incense to Jupiter.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But they, converted by her wise teaching,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Wept very bitterly, and gave full credence<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Unto her word, and cried more and more,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Christ, God's Son, without difference [between Father and Son],<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Is true God -- this is the belief of us all -- <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That has so good a servant to serve Him.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This unanimously we believe, even if we should die!"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Almachius, that heard of this business,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Ordered (his men to) fetch Cecile, so that he might see her<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And first of all, lo, this was his quesation.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "What sort of woman art thou?" then said he.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "I am a gentle woman born," said she.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "I ask thee," said he, "though it may grieve thee,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; About thy religion and about thy belief."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "You have begun your question foolishly,"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Said she, "you who would include two answers <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In one question; you asked ignorantly."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Almache answered unto that refutation,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Of whence comes thine answering so rude?"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Of whence?" said she, when she was asked,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Of conscience and of sincere good faith."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Almachius said, "Takest thou no heed<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of my power?" And she answered him this:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Your might," said she, "is very little to fear,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For every mortal man's power is nothing <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But only like a bladder full of wind, indeed.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For with a needle's point, when it is blown up,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Can all the arrogance of it be laid full low."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Full wrongfully thou began," said he,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "And yet wrongful is thy perseverance.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Dost thou not know how our mighty noble princes<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Have thus commanded and made a law<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That every Christian person shall be punished<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Unless he renounce his Christian faith,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And go all free, if he will deny it?"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Your princes err, as your nobles do,"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Said then Cecile, "and with a crazy verdict<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You make us guilty, and it is not true.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For you, who know well our innocence,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Forasmuch as we do reverence<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To Christ, and because we bear a Christian name,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You accuse us of a crime and also (put on us) the blame for it.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "But we who know that same name <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To be so virtuous, we can not deny it."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Almache answered, "Chose one of these two:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Do sacrifice, or renounce Christendom,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So that thou can now escape by that means."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; At which the holy blissful fair maid<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Began to laugh, and to the judge said:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "O judge, confused in thy folly,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Wilt thou that I renounce innocence,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To make myself a wicked person?" said she.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Lo, he hides his true feelings here in open court; <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He stares, and goes mad in his mind!"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To whom Almachius, "Miserable wretch,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Knowest thou not how far my power can stretch?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Have not our mighty princes to me given,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Yea, both power and authority<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To make folk to die or to live?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Why speakest thou so proudly then to me?"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "I speak only faithfully," said she;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Not proudly, for I say, as for my side,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We hate that same deadly sin of pride.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "And if thou dread not to hear a truth,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Then will I show all openly, according to law,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That thou hast made a very great lie here.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thou sayest thy princes have given thee power<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Both to slay and to give life to a person;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thou, who can only take away life,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thou hast no other power nor any authority.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "But thou can say thy princes have made thee<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Minister of death; for if thou speak of more,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thou liest, for thy power is strictly limited.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Do away thy boldness," said Almachius then,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "And sacrifice to our gods ere thou go!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I care not what wrong that thou may express to me,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For I can suffer it as a philosopher;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "But those same wrongs I can not endure<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Which thou spekest of our gods here," said he.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Cecile answered, "O foolish creature!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thou saidest no word since thou spoke to me<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That I did not know therewith thy foolishness<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And that thou were in every sort of way<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; An ignorant officer and a foolish judge.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "There lacks nothing to thine outer eyes<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Except that thou art blind; for thing that we all see <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That it is stone -- that men can well see --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That same stone a god thou wilt call it.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I advise thee, let thine hand upon it fall<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And taste it well, and stone thou shalt find it,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Since thou seest not with thy blind eyes.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "It is a shame that the people shall<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So scorn thee and laugh at thy folly,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For without exception men know it well everywhere<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That mighty God is in his high heavens;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And these images, thou canst well see,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Can do no profit to thee nor to themselves,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For in fact they are not worth a penny."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; These words and others such said she,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And he grew angry, and ordered that men should lead her<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Home to her house, and "In her house," said he,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Burn her right in a bath of red flames."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And as he ordered, exactly so the deed was done;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For they did shut her fast in a cauldron,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And night and day they fed great fire under it.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The long night, and also a day as well,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Despite the fire and also the bath's heat <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She sat all cool and felt no pain.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It made her not a drop to sweat.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But in that bath her life she must leave,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For that Almachius, with completely wicked intent,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Sent his messenger to slay her in the bath.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Three strokes in the neck he smote her then,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The executioner, but in no sort of way<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He could not smite all her neck in two;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And because there was that time an ordinance<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That no man should do any one such pain<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The fourth stroke to smite, soft or sore,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This executioner dared not do any more,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But half dead, with her neck carved there,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He left her lie, and on his way he went.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Christian folk, who were about her,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With sheets have very carefully taken up the blood.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Three days she lived in this torment,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And never ceased to teach them the faith <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That she had fostered; to them she did preach,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And she gave them her personal property and her things,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And to the Pope Urban (she) entrusted them then,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And said, "I asked this of heaven's king,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To have respite three days and no more<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To commend to you, ere I go,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; These souls, lo, and that I might have made<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Here of my house perpetually a church."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Saint Urban with his deacons secretly<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Fetched the body and buried it by night<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Among his other saints decently.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Her house is called the church of Saint Cecilie;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Saint Urban consecrated it, as he well could;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In which, unto this day, in noble manner,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; People do service to Christ and to his saint.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When the life of Saint Cecile was ended,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Before we had ridden a good five miles,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; At Boghtoun under Blee overtook us <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A man who was clothed in black clothes,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And underneath that he had a white surplice.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His riding horse, that was all dapple gray,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So sweated that it was a wonder to see;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It seemed as if he had spurred hard for three miles.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The horse also that his yeoman rode upon<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So sweated that it could hardly move.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; About the collar stood the foam very high;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He was by foam all flecked like a magpie.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A double bag on his crupper lay;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It seemed that he carried little gear.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; All lightly clad for summer rode this worthy man,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And in my heart I began to wonder<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What he was until I understood<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; How his cloak was sewn to his hood,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For which, when I had long thought about it,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I judged him to be some sort of canon.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His hat hung at his back down by a strap,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For he had ridden at more than a trot or a walk;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He had always spurred as if he were crazy.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A burdock-leaf he had under his hood<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For sweat and to keep his head from heat.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But what a joy it was to see him sweat!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His forehead dripped like a still<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Full of the herbs plantain and pellitory.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And when he was come to us, he began to cry out,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "God save," said he, "this jolly company!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Fast have I spurred," said he, "for your sake,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Because I wanted to overtake you,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To ride in this merry company."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His yeoman also was full of courtesy,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And said, "Sirs, just now in the morning time<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I saw you ride out of your hostelry,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And told my lord here and my sovereign,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who is very eager to ride with you <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For his pleasure; he loves sociability."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Friend, for thy telling him God give thee good luck,"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Then said our Host, "for certainly it would seem<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thy lord is wise, and as I can well judge.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He is very cheerful also, I dare wager!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Can he in any way tell a merry tale or two,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With which he may gladden this company?"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Who, sir? My lord? Yes, yes, without lie,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He knows about mirth and also about jollity<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; More than enough; also, sir, trust me,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If you knew him as well as do I,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You would wonder how well and craftily<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He knows how to work, and that in a variety of ways.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He has taken on him many a great enterprise,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Which would be very hard for any one who is here<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To bring about, unless they learn it from him.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Despite how modestly he rides amongst you,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If you knew him, it would be to your advantage.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You would not forgo his acquaintance<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For great riches, I dare wager on that<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; All that I have in my possession.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He is a man of great discretion;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I tell you indeed, he is a remarkable man."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Well," said our Host, "I pray thee, tell me then,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Is he a clerk, or not? Tell what he is."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Nay, he is greater than a clerk, indeed,"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Said this Yeoman, "and in few words,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Host, I will show you something of his craft.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "I say, my lord knows such esoteric science --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But all his craft you can not know from me,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And yet somewhat I help in his work --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That all this ground on which we are riding,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Until we come to Canterbury town,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He could turn all completely upside down,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And pave it all with silver and with gold."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And when this Yeoman had this tale told<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Unto our Host, he said, "Bless you!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This thing is wonderfully marvelous to me,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Since thy lord is of such great prudence,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Because of which men should reverence him,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That he cares so little for his own self-respect.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His outer garment is not worth a fraction of a penny,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Because in fact, to him, as I may go (I swear), <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It is all dirty and tattered also.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Why is thy lord so slovenly, I pray thee,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And has the power to buy better cloth,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If his deeds accord with thy speech?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Tell me that, and of that I beseech thee."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Why?" said this Yeoman, "why do you ask me?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So help me God, for he shall never prosper!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (But I will not publicly acknowledge what I say,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And therefore keep it secret, I pray you.)<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He is too wise, in faith, as I believe.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That which is done too much, it will not turn out<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Right, as clerks say; it is a vice.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Therefore in that I hold him ignorant and foolish.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For when a man has too great a wit,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Very often he happens to misuse it.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So does my lord, and that sorely grieves me;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; God amend it! I can tell you no more."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "That does not matter, good Yeoman," said our Host;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Since thou knowest of the cunning of thy lord,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Tell how he does, I pray thee heartily,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Since he is so crafty and so sly.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Where do you dwell, if it can be told?"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "In the outskirts of a town," said he,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Lurking in hiding places and in dead-end alleys,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Where these robbers and these thieves by nature<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Hold their private fearful residence,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Like those who dare not show their presence;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So fare we, if I shall say the truth."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Now," said our Host, "yet let me talk to thee.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Why art thou so discolored in thy face?"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Peter!" said he, "God give it bad luck,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I am so used to blow in the fire <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That it has changed my color, I believe.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I am not accustomed to peer in any mirror,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But to work hard and to learn to transmute metals.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We blunder ever and stare in the fire,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And despite all that, we fail to achieve our desire,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For ever we lack our desired conclusion.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To many folk we do delusion,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And borrow gold, be it a pound or two,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or ten, or twelve, or many greater sums,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And make them believe, at the very least,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That of one pound we could make two.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Yet is it false, but always we have good hope<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To do it, and after it we grope.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But that knowledge is so far ahead of us,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We can not, although we had sworn it,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Overtake it, it slides away so fast.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It will make us beggars at the last."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; While this Yeoman was thus in his talking,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This Canon drew himself nearer and heard every thing<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Which this Yeoman spoke, for suspicion<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of men's speech ever had this Canon.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For Cato says that he who is guilty<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Believes every thing is spoken about him, indeed.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That was the cause he did draw himself so near <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To his Yeoman, to hear all his speech.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And thus he said unto his Yeoman then:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Hold thou thy peace and speak no more words,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For if thou do, thou shalt dearly pay for it.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thou slanderest me here in this company,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And also revealest what thou shouldest hide."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Yes," said our Host, "tell on, whataever may happen.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Reckon all his threatening not worth a fraction of a penny!" <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "In faith," said he, "I do (reckon him) but little any more."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And when this Canon saw it would not be,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But that his Yeoman would tell his secrets,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He fled away for true sorrow and shame.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Ah!" said the Yeoman, "here shall arise some amusement;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Right now I will tell all that I know.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Since he is gone, may the foul fiend kill him!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For never hereafter will I meet with him <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For penny nor for pound, I promise you.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He who brought me first unto that game,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Before he dies, may he have sorrow and shame!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For it is serious (not game) to me, by my faith;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That feel I well, whatever any man says.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And yet, for all my pain and all my grief,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For all my sorrow, labor, and mischief,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I could never leave it in any way.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Now I wish to God my wit might suffice<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To tell all that belongs to that art!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But nonetheless you desire that I tell part.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Since my lord is gone, I will not spare;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Such things as what I know, I will declare.<BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; [<i>[First Part</i>]
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With this Canon I have dwelt seven years,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And as to his science I am never the nearer (to success).<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; All that I had I have lost thereby,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And, God knows, so have many more than I.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Where I was accustomed to be right fresh and gay<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of clothing and of other splendid furnishings,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Now may I wear a hose upon my head;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And whereas my color was both fresh and red,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Now is it pale and of a leaden hue --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Whoever uses it (that art), sorely shall he rue! --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And by my work yet my eye is bleared.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Lo, how profitable it is to transute metals!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That slippery science has made me so bare <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That I have no possessions, wherever I fare;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And yet by this I am so indebted <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For gold that I have borrowed, truly,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That while I live I shall never repay it.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Let every man be warned by me forever!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Whatever sort of man that applies himself to that,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If he continue, I consider his prosperity done for.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For so help me God, he shall not profit thereby,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But empty his purse and make his wits thin.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And when he through his madness and folly<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Has lost his own possessions in this dangerous business,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Then he incites other folk to that,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To lose their possessions as he himself has done.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For unto scoundrels it is joy and ease<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To have their fellows in pain and hardship.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thus was I once taught by a clerk.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; No matter about that; I will speak of our work.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When we are where we shall exercise<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Our mysterious craft, we seem wonderfully wise,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Our terms are so scholarly and so strange.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I blow the fire until my heart faints.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Why should I tell each proportion<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of the things that we work upon --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As on five or six ounces, it may well be,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of silver, or some other quantity --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And busy myself to tell you the names<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of orpiment (arsenic trisulfide), burned bones, iron flakes,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That are ground into very fine powder;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And how all is put in an earthen pot,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And salt put in, and also pepper,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Before these powders that I speak of here;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And well covered with a lamp-shaped vessel of glass;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And of many other things which were there;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And sealing of the pot and glasses<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So that not a bit of the air could pass out;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And of the slow fir, and fast also,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Which was made, and of the care and woe<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That we had in purifying our materials,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And in blending and reducing to powder<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of quicksilver, called raw mercury?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Despite all our tricks we can not succeed.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Our orpiment (arsenic trisulfide), and purified mercury,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Our litharge (lead monoxide) ground also on the porphyry mortar,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A certain number of ounces of each of these --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Nothing helps us; our labor is in vain.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Also neither our spirit's vaporization,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Nor our materials that remain fixed in the pot,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Can in any way help us in our working,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For all our labor and travail is lost;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And all the expenditure, in the name of twenty devils,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Which we spent upon it, is lost also.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There is also very many another thing<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That pertains unto our craft.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Though I can not list them in their proper order,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Because I am an unlearned man,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Yet will I tell them as they come to mind,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Though I can not set them in their proper categories:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Such as armenian bol (red clay), verdigris (copper acetate), borax,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And various vessels made of clay and glass,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Our urinals and our retorts,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Vials, crucibles, and sublimation vessels,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Vessels for distilling and alembics also,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And other such things, very expensive at the price of a leek --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There ia no need to list them all --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Liquids that cause reddening, and bull's gall,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Arsenic, sal ammoniac, and brimstone;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And herbs could I tell also many a one,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Such as agrimony, valerian, and moonwort,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And other such things, if I wanted to tarry;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Our lamps burning both night and day,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To bring about our purpose, if we can;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Also our furnace for reducing substances to powder,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And of whitening by liquids;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Unslaked lime, chalk, and white of an egg,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Various powders, ashes, dung, piss, and clay,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Waxed (waterproofed) packets, saltpeter, sulphuric acid,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And various sorts of fires made of wood and coal;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Potassium nitrate, alkali, and purified salt,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And burned materials and solidified;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Clay made with horse or man's hair, and oil<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of tartar, crystallized alum, yeast, unfermented malt, and argol,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Arsenic, and soaking our materials,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And also of forming a compound of our materials,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And of turning our silver to a yellow color,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Our fusion by heat and fermentation,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Our casting molds, crucibles for testing, and many more.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I will tell you, as it was taught also to me,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The four spirits and the seven metals<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; By order, as often I heard my lord name them.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The first spirit is called quicksilver,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The second orpiment (arsenic trisulfide), the third, indeed,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Sal ammoniac, and the fourth brimstone.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The seven metals also, lo, hear them now:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Sun is gold, and Moon silver we say,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Mars iron, Mercury we call quicksilver,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Saturn lead, and Jupiter is tin,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And Venus copper, by my father's kin!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Whoever will exercise this cursed craft,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He shall have no wealth that can be enough for him,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For all the wealth he spends on this<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He shall lose; of that have I no doubt.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Whoever desires to make public his folly,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Let him come forth and learn to transmute base metals;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And every man that has anything in his strong-box,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Let him appear and become an alchemist.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Is that craft were so easy to learn?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Nay, nay, God knows, be he monk or friar,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Priest or canon, or any other creature,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Though he sit at his book both day and night<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In learning of this mysterious foolish lore,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; All is in vain, and by God, much more.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To teach an ignorant man this ingenious skill --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Fie! Speak not about that, for it will not be.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And know he book learning or know he none,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In fact, he shall find it all the same.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For both of the two, by my salvation,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Conclude in transmutation<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Equally well, when they are all done;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This is to say, they fail, both of the two.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Yet I forgot to make enumeration <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of acidic waters, and of metal filings,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And of the softening of materials,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And also of their hardening;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Oils, cleansings, and fusible metal --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To tell all would be longer than any large book<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That is anywhere; therefore, as for the best,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of all these names now I will rest myself,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For, as I believe, I have told you enough<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To raise a fiend, though he look never so rough.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Ah! Nay! Let be; the philosophers' stone,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Called Elixir, we seek earnestly each one of us;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For if we had it, then we would be very well off.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But unto God of heaven I make avow,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Despite all our craft, when we have all done,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And all our skill, he will not come us to.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He has made us spend much money,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For sorrow of which we almost go mad,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Except that good hope creeps into our heart,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Supposing ever, though we sorely suffer,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To be relieved by him afterward.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Such supposing and hope is sharp and hard;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I warn you well, it is to keep seeking forever.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That future tense has made men to be separated,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In trust on that, from all that ever they had.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Yet of that art they can not be satisfied,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For unto them it is a bitter sweet --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So it seems -- for had they nothing but a sheet<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Which they might wrap themselves in at night,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And a rough cloak to walk in by daylight,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They would sell them and spend it on this craft.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They can not stop until nothing is left.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And evermore, wherever they go,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Men can know them by the smell of brimstone.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For all the world they stink like a goat;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Their odor is so like a goat and so intense<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That though a man be a mile from them,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The odor will infect him, trust me.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Lo, thus by smelling and threadbare array,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If men so desire, this folk they can know.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And if a man will ask them privily<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Why they are clothed so poorly,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They right away will whisper in his ear,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And say that if they were recognized,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Men would slay them because of their knowledge.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Lo, thus these folk betray innocence!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Pass over this; I go unto my tale.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Before the pot on the fire is done,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With a specific quantity of metals,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; My lord tempers them, and no man but he --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Now he is gone, I dare say boldly --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For, as men say, he can work craftily.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Although I know well he has such a reputation;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And yet very often he gets in trouble.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And do you know how? Full often it so happens<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The pot shatters, and farewell, all is gone!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; These metals are of such great violence<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The sides of our vessels can not make resistance to them,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Unless they were made of lime and stone;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They pierce so, and through the wall they go.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And some of them sink into the ground --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thus have we quickly lost many a pound --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And some are scattered all over the floor;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Some leap into the roof. Without doubt,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Though the fiend does not show himself to our sight,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I believe he is with us, that same scoundrel!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In hell, where he is lord and sire,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There is no greater woe, nor greater rancor nor ire.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When our pot is broken, as I have said,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Every man chides and considers himsef ill used.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Some said it was due to the making of the fire;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Some said nay, it was due to the blowing --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Then was I afraid, for that was my job.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Rubbish!" said the third, "you are ignorant and foolish.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It was not tempered as it ought to be."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Nay," said the fourth, "be quiet and listen to me.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Because our fire was not made of beech,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That is the cause and none other, as I may prosper!"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I can not tell what it was due to,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But well I know great strife is among us.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Well," said my lord, "there is no more to do;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of these perils I will be wary next time.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I am very sure that the pot was cracked.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Be as be may, be you in no way amazed;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As our practice is, have the floor quickly swept,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Pluck up your hearts and be glad and blithe."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The rubbish was swept in a heap,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And on the floor was cast a canvas,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And all this rubbish thrown in a sieve <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And sifted, and picked over many a time.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "By God," said one, "something of our metal<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Yet is there here, though we have not all.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And though this thing may have turned out badly this time,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Another time it may go well indeed.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We must put our possessions at risk.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A merchant, by God, may not endure forever,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Trust me well, in his prosperity.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Sometimes his goods are drowned in the sea,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And sometime they come safely unto the land."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Quiet!" said my lord, "the next time I will endeavor<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To bring our experiment to an entirely different state,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And unless I do, sirs, let me have the blame.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There was something wrong, I well know."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Another said the fire was too hot --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But, be it hot or cold, I dare say this,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That we conclude always with something gone wrong.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We fail to get that which we want to have,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And in our madness always we rave.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And when we are all together every one,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Every man seems a Solomon.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But every thing thah shines like gold<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Is not gold, as I have heard said;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Nor every apple that is fair to the eye<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Is not good, whatever men may chatter or cry.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Right so, lo, it fares among us:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He who seems the wisest, by Jesus,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Is the greatest fool, when it comes to the proof;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And he that seems truest is a thief.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That shall you know, before I from you wend,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; By the time that I have made an end of my tale.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There is a canon regular<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Amongst us, who would infect a whole town,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Though it were as big as was Nineveh,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Rome, Alexandria, Troy, and any three others.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His tricks and his infinite falseness<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; No man could write, as I guess,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Though he might live a thousand years.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In all this world is not his equal in falsehood,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For in his technical terms he will so wrap himself,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And speak his words in so deceitful a manner,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When he shall converse with any person,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That he will make a fool of him right away,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Unless it be a fiend, as he himself is.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Very many a man has he beguiled before this,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And will, if he may live a while longer;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And yet men ride and walk very many a mile<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To seek him and have his acquaintance,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Not knowing of his false way of life.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And if you want to listen to me,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I will tell it here in your presence.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But worshipful religious canons,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Do not think that I slander your house,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Although my tale be about a canon.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There is some scoundrel in every order, by God,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And God forbid that a whole company<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Should suffer for one single man's folly.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To slander you is not at all my intention,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But I mean to correct what is amiss.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This tale was not only told for you,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But also for many others; you know well <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That among Christ's twelve apostles <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There was no traitor but Judas himself.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Then why should all the remnant have the blame<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who were guiltless? Concerning you I say the same,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Save only this, if you will listen to me:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If any Judas be in your convent,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Remove him quickly, I advise you,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If the prospect of shame or dishonor can cause any fear.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And be not at all displeased, I pray you,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But in this case listen to what I shall say.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In London was a priest, a chantry priest,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who therein had dwelled many a year,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who was so pleasant and so attentive<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Unto the woman, where he took his meals,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That she would not allow him to pay anything<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For board nor clothing, went he never so gay,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And he had plenty of spending money.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That does not not matter; I will now proceed,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And tell forth my tale of the canon<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who brought this priest to ruin.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This false canon came upon one day<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Unto this priest's chamber, where he stayed,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Beseeching him to lend him a certain amount<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of gold, and he would pay it back to him again.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Loan me a mark," said he, "for only three days,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And at my assigned day I will repay it to thee.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And if it so be that thou find me false,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The next day have me hanged by the neck!"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This priest gave him a mark, and that very quickly,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And this canon thanked him many times,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And took his leave, and went forth on his way,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And at the third day brought his money,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And to the priest he gave back his gold,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For which this priest was wonderfully glad and happy.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Certainly," said he, "in no way does it annoy me<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To lend a man a noble, or two, or three,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or whatever thing if it were in my possession,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When he is so true, of such character<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That in no way will he fail to pay on his assigned day:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To such a man I can never say no."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "What!" said this canon, "should I be untrue?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Nay, that would be a thing completely without precedent.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; My pledged word is a thing that I will always keep<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Until that day in which I shall creep<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Into my grave, and God forbid it be otherwise.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Believe this is as true as your Creed.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I thank God, and rightly it may be said,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That there was never man yet suffered evil<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For gold or silver that he lent to me,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Nor did I ever intend falsehood in my heart.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And sir," said he, "now some of my secrets,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Since you have been so goodly unto me,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And shown to me such great courtesy,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Something with which to repay your kindness<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I will show you, and if you want to learn,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I will teach you fully the manner<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; How I know how to to work in alchemy.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Pay cl,ose attention; you shall well see by eye<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That I will do a masterful work before I go."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Yes," said the priest, "yes, sir, and will you so?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; By Saint Mary, for that I pray you heartily."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "At your commandment, sir, truly,"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Said the canon, "and otherwise God forbid!"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Lo, how this thief could offer his service!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Very true it is that such a favor not asked for<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Stinks, as these old wise writers bear witness,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And very soon I will verify it<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In (the deeds of) this canon, root of all treachery,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who evermore has delight and gladness --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Such fiendish thoughts in his heart are fixed --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; How he can bring Christ's people to mischief.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; God keep us from his false dissimulation!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This priest knew not with whom he dealt,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And of his coming harm he felt nothing.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; O hapless priest! O hapless innocent!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Very soon thou shalt be blinded by greed!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; O unfortunate, completely blind is thy mind,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In no way art thou aware of the deceit<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Which this fox has destined for thee!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His cunning deceptions thou canst not flee.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Therefore, to go to the conclusion,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That refers to thy ruin,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Unhappy man, right now I will hasten myself<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To tell thy lack of prudence and thy folly,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And also the falseness of that other wretch,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Insofar as my skill will stretch.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This canon was my lord, you would suppose?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Sir host, in faith, and by the heaven's queen,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It was another canon, and not he,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who knows a hundred times more trickery.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He has betrayed folks many a time;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It distresses me to compose rimes about his falseness.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Every time I speak of his falsehood,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For shame of him my cheeks grow red.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; At least they begin to glow,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For redness have I none, very well I know,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In my visage; for various fumes<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of metals, which you have heard me rehearse,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That have consumed and wasted my redness.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Now pay attention to this canon's cursedness!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Sir," said he to the priest, "have your man go<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For quicksilver, would that we had it right now;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And have him bring two or three ounces;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And when he comes, quickly you shall see<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A wonderful thing, which you never saw before this."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Sir," said the priest, "it shall be done, indeed."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He bad his servant fetch him this thing,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And he was all ready at his bidding,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And went forth, and came right back again<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With this quicksilver, shortly to say,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And gave these three ounces to the canon;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And he laid them down neatly and carefully,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And bad the servant to bring coals,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So that he might go to his working right away.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The coals right away were fetched,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And this canon took out a crucible<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; From his bosom, and showed it to the priest.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "This instrument," said he, "which thou seest,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Take in thy hand, and thyself put therein<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; An ounce of this quicksilver, and here begin,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In the name of Christ, to become an alchemist.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There are very few to whom I would offer<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To show them thus so much of my science.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For you shall see here, by experience,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That this quicksilver I will harden<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Right in your sight indeed, without lie,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And make it as good silver and as fine<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As there is any in your purse or mine,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or elsewhere, and make it malleable;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And otherwise consider me false and unable<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For ever to appear amongst folk.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I have a powder here, that cost me dearly,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Shall make all good, for it is cause of all<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; My cunning, which I shall show you.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Send away your man, and have him be outside,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And shut the door, while we are about<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Our secret business, so that no man espy us,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; While we work in this science."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; All was in deed fulfilled as he commanded.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This same servant right away went out,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And his master shut the door quickly,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And to their labor speedily they go.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This priest, at this cursed canon's bidding,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Upon the fire at once set this thing,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And blew the fire, and busied himself very intently.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And this canon into the crucible cast<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A powder, I do not know of what it was<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Made, either of chalk, or of glass,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or something else, that was not worth a fly,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With which to blind this priest; and bade him hasten<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To lay all the coals above<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The crucible. "To serve as a sign that I love thee,"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Said this canon, "thine own two hands<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Shall do every thing that shall here be done."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Many thanks," said the priest, and was very glad,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And laid the coals as the canon bad.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And while he was busy, this fiendish wretch,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This false canon -- may the foul fiend fetch him! --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Out of his bosom took a beech coal,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In which very skilfully was made a hole,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And therein was put of silver filings<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; An ounce, and was sealed shut, without doubt, <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This hole with wax, to keep the filings in.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And understand that this false device<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Was not made there, but it was made before;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And other things I shall tell more<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Later, which he brought with him.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Before he came there, he intended to trick him,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And so he did, before they went apart;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Until he had skinned him, he could not cease.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It distresses me when I speak of him.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I would like to avenge myself for his falsehood,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If I knew how, but he is now here and now there;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He is so changeable, he abides nowhere.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But pay attention now, sirs, for God's love!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He took his coal of which I spoke above,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And in his hand he bore it secretly.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And while the priest busily laid<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The coals, as I told you before this,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This canon said, "Friend, you do it wrong.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This is not arranged as it ought to be;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But soon I shall amend it," said he.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Now let me work with it but a while,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For I have pity of you, by Saint Gile!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You are very hot; I see well how you sweat.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Have here a cloth, and wipe away the wetness."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And while the priest wiped his face,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This canon took his coal -- may he have bad luck! --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And laid it above, upon the middle<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of the crucible, and blew well afterward<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Until the coals began to burn fast.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Now give us drink," said the canon then;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Soon all shall be well, I guarantee.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Sit we down, and let us make merry."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And when this canon's beech coal<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Was burned, all the filings out of the hole<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Into the crucible fell right down;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And so it must be necessarily, by reason,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Since it was placed so exactly above.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But of this the priest knew nothing, alas!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He thought all the coals equally good,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For he understood nothing of that trick.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And when this alchemist saw his time,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Rise up," said he, "sir priest, and stand by me;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And because I know well you have no ingot,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Go, walk forth, and bring a chalk stone;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For I will make it of the same shape<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As is an ingot, if I may have such luck.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And bring also with you a bowl or a pan<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Full of water, and you shall see well then<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; How our business shall thrive and succeed.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And yet, so that you shall have no suspicion<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Nor wrong opinion of me in your absence,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I will not be out of your presence,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But go with you and come with you again."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The chamber door, shortly to say,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They opened and shut, and went their way.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And forth with them they carried the key,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And came back again without any delay.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Why should I tarry all the long day?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He took the chalk and shaped it in the manner<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of an ingot, as I shall tell you.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I say, he took out of his own sleeve<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A small bar of silver -- may he have evil luck! --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Which was not more than an ounce of weight.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And pay attention now to his cursed trick!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He shaped his ingot in the length and in the breadth<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of this small bar, without any doubt,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So slyly that the priest did not see it, <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And in his sleeve again he did hide it,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And from the fire he took up his material,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And put it in the ingot with merry demeanor,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And in the pan of water he cast it,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When it pleased him, and commanded the priest quickly,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "See what is there; put in thy hand and grope.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thou shalt find there silver, as I believe."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What else, devil of hell, should it be?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Shaving of silver is silver, by God!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He put his hand in and took up a small bar<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of pure silver, and glad in every vein<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Was this priest, when he saw it was so.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "God's blessing, and his mother's also,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And all saints, have you (in their protection), sir canon,"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Said the priest, "and may I have their curse,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But, if you condescend to teach me<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This noble craft and this esoteric art,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I will be yours in all that ever I can."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Said the canon, "Yet I will make trial <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The second time, that you may pay attention<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And be expert concerning this, and when you are in need<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Some other day in my absence to try out<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This discipline and this ingenious science.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Let's take another ounce," said he then,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Of quicksilver, without more words,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And do therewith as you have done before this<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With that other, which now is silver."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This priest busies himself in all that he knows how<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To do as this canon, this cursed man,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Commanded him, and blew hard on the fire,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In order to come to the realization of his desire.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And this canon, at exactly the same time,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Was all ready to beguile this priest again,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And for show in his hand he bore<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A hollow stick -- pay attention and beware! --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In the end of which an ounce, and no more,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of silver filings was put, as before<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Was in his coal, and well sealed shut with wax<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To keep in his filings every bit.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And while this priest was busy with his work,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This canon with his stick began to go<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To him right away, and his powder cast in<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As he did before-- the devil out of his skin<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Flay him, I pray to God, for his falsehood!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For he was ever false in thought and deed --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And with this stick, above the crucible,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That was prepared with that false contrivance,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He stirred the coals until it began to melt<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The wax next to the fire, as every man,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Unless he be a fool, knows well it must by necessity,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And all that was in the stick went out,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And into the crucible it quickly fell.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Now, good sirs, what more will you have?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When this priest was thus beguiled again,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Supposing nothing but truth, sooth to say,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He was so glad that I can not express<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In any manner his mirth and his gladness;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And to the canon he offered again<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Body and possessions. "Yes," quickly said the canon,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Though I be poor, thou shalt find me skilfull.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I warn thee, there is yet more to come.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Is there any copper here?" said he.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Yes," said the priest, "sir, I believe well there is some."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Otherwise go buy us some, and do that quickly;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Now, good sir, go forth thy way and hurry thee."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He went his way, and with the copper came back,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And this canon took it in his hands,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And of that copper weighed out only an ounce.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; All too simple is my tongue to pronounce,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As servant of my wit, the duplicity<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of this canon, root of all cursedness!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He seemed friendly to those that did not know him,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But he was fiendish both in deed and thought.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It wearies me to tell of his falseness,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And nonetheless I will yet express it,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With the intention that men may be warned by this,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And for no other cause, truly.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He put this ounce of copper in the crucible,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And on the fire quickly he has set it,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And cast in powder, and made the priest to blow,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And in his working to stoop low,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As he did before -- and all was nothing but a trick;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Exactly as he wished, he made the priest his ape!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And afterward he cast the ingot in it,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And put it at the last into the pan <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of water, and in he put his own hand,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And in his sleeve (as you before-hand<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Heard me tell) he had a small bar of silver.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He slyly took it out, this cursed rascal,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This priest not knowing of his false craft,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And in the pan's bottom he has left it;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And in the water groped noisily about to and fro,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And wonderfully secretly took up also <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The copper bar, this priest not knowing,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And hid it, and grabbed him by his coat,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And to him spoke, and thus said jokingly:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Stoop down. By God, you are to blame!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Help me now, as I did you before;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Put in your hand, and see what is there."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This priest quickly took up this silver bar,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And then said the canon, "Let us go<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With these three bars, which we have wrought,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To some goldsmith and learn if they are worth anything,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For, by my faith, I would not (have them), for (the cost of) my hood,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Unless they be silver pure and good,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And that very quickly shall be tested."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Unto the goldsmith with these three bars<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They went and put these bars to the test<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of fire and hammer; no man could say nay,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But that they were as they ought to be.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This deluded priest, who was gladder than he?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Was never bird more glad at daybreak,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Nor nightingale in the season of May,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Was never none that was more eager to sing;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Nor lady more enthusiastic in singing carols to spring,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or to speak of love and womanhood,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Nor knight in arms to do a hardy deed,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To stand in the good graces of his dear lady,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Than this priest had to learn this sorry craft.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And to the canon thus he spoke and said:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "For love of God, Who died for us all,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And as I may deserve (to have) it from you,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What shall this recipe cost? Tell now!"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "By our Lady," said this canon, "it is expensive,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I warn you well; for except for me and a friar,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There is no man in England who can make it."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "No matter," said he, "now, sir, for God's sake,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What shall I pay? Tell me, I pray."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Indeed," said he, "as I say, it is very expensive.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Sir, at one word, if thou want to have it,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You must pay forty pounds, so help me God!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And were it not for the act of friendship that before this you did<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To me, you should pay more, indeed."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This priest right away the sum of forty pounds <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of nobles fetched, and gave every one of them<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To this canon for this same recipe.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; All his working was nothing but fraud and deceit.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Sir priest," he said, "I do not care to have fame<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For my craft, for I would that it were kept confidential;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And, as you love me, keep it secret.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For, if men knew of all my esoteric skill,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; By God, they would have so great envy<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of me because of my science<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I should be dead; there would be no other way."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "God forbid it," said the priest, "what say you?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Yet would I rather spend all the wealth<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That I have, and otherwise I would rather go mad,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Than that you should fall in such distress."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "For your good will, sir, you have givem right good proof,"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Said the canon, "and farewell, many thanks!"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He went his way, and never the priest him saw<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; After that day; and when this priest should<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; At such time as he wanted, make a trial <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of this recipe, farewell! It would not work.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Lo, thus tricked and beguiled was he!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thus he makes his introductory gambit,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To bring folk to their destruction.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Consider, sirs, how, in each social rank,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Betwixt men and gold there is conflict <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So widespread that there is hardly any gold left.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This transmutation blinds so many a one<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That in good faith I believe that it is<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The greatest cause of such scarcity.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Philosophers speak so mystically<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; About this craft that men can not come to it,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For any wit that men have now-a-days.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They may well chatter as do jays,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And in their technical terms set their desire and pain,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But to their purpose shall they never attain.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A man can easily learn, if he have anything,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To transmute metals, and bring his wealth to nothing!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Lo! such a profit is in this pleasing game,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It will turn a man's mirth into sorrow,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And empty also great and heavy purses,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And make folk to deserve curses<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of those who have lent their wealth for that purpose.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; O, fie, for shame! Those who have been burned,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Alas, can they not flee the fire's heat?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You who use it, I advise you let it go,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Lest you lose all; for late is better than never.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Never to thrive would be too long a time.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Though you search forever, you shall never find it.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You are as heedless as is Bayard the blind horse,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That blunders forth and takes account of no peril.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He is as likely to run against a stone<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As to go around it in the road.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So fare you who multiply, I say.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If your eyes can not see clearly,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; See that your mind lacks nothing of its sight.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For though you look never so broadly and stare,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You shall gain nothing on that transaction,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But waste all that you can steal and carry away.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Withdraw the fire, lest it burn too fast;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Meddle no more with that art, I mean,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For if you do, your prosperity is completely gone.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And very quickly I will you tell here<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What alchemists say in this matter.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Lo, thus says Arnold of the New Town,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As his book Rosari makes mention;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He says right thus, without any lie:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "There is no man who can harden mercury <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Unless it be with his brother's knowledge";<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Although he who first said this thing<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Was father of philosophers, Hermes Trismegistus;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He says that the dragon, doubtless,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Does not die unless he be slain<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; By his brother; and that is to say,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; By the dragon, Mercury, and none other<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He understood, and brimstone by his brother,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That out of Sol (gold) and Luna (silver) were drawn.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "And therefore," said he -- take heed of my words --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Let no man busy himself to seek this art,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Unless he the meaning and speech<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of alchemists can understand;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And if he do, he is an ignorant man.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For this science and this cunning," said he,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Concerns the secret of the secrets, by God."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Also there was a disciple of Plato,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That one time said to his master,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As his book Senior will bear witness,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And this was his question in truth:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Tell me the name of the secret stone."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And Plato answered unto him straightaway,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Take the stone that men name Titanos."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "What is that?" said he. "Magnesia is the same,"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Said Plato. "Yes, sir, and is it thus?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This is explaining the unknown by the more unknown.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What is Magnesia, good sir, I pray you?"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "It is a liquid that is made, I say,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of the four elements," said Plato.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Good sir," said he then, "Tell me the basic constituent<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Of that liquid, if it be your wish."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Nay, nay," said Plato, "certainly, that I will not.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The alchemists were sworn every single one<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That they should reveal it unto no one,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Nor in any book write it in any way.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For unto Christ it is so beloved and dear<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That He does not wish that it be discovered,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Except where it is pleasing to his deity<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To enlighten men, and also to forbid<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Whomever he pleases; lo, this is the end."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Then I conclude thus, since God of heaven<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Does not wish that the alchemists should tell<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; How a man shall come unto this stone,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I advise, as for the best, let it go.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For whoever makes God his adversary,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As to do any thing in contrary<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To his will, certainly, never shall he thrive,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Though he practice alchemy all his life.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And there (put) a period, for my tale is ended.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; God send every true man remedy for his troubles!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But one word, lords, hear before I go:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It would be very difficult to find now-a-days<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In all the town Griseldas three or two;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For if they were put to such tests,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The gold of them has now been so badly debased<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With brass, that though the coin be fair to look at,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It would rather break in two than bend.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For which here, for the love of the Wife of Bath --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Whose life and all her sect may God maintain<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In high mastery, and otherwise it would be a pity --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I will with lusty heart, fresh and vigorous,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Say you a song to make you happy, I believe;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And let us stint of serious matter.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Hear my song that says in this manner:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Griselda is dead, and also her patience,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And both together buried in Italy;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For which I cry in the hearing of all<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; No wedded man so bold be to test<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His wife's patience trusting to find<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Griselda, for certainly he shall faille.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; O noble wives, full of great prudence,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Let no humility nail down your tongue,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Nor let any clerk have cause or eagerness<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To write about you a story of such marvel<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As of patient and kind Griselda,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Lest Chichevache swallow you in her entrails!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Follow Echo, who holds no silence,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But ever answers in reply.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Be not fooled because of your innocence,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But eagerly take the governance to yourself.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Imprint well this lesson in your mind,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Since it may work to the benefit of all.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You arch-wives, stand ready for battle,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Since you are strong as is a great camel;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Suffer not that men do offense to you.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And slender wives, feeble in battle,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Be fierce as is a tiger yonder in India;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Ever wag your tongues like a windmill, I you advise.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Fear them not; do them no reverence,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For though thy husband be armed in mail,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The arrows of thy spiteful eloquence<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Shall pierce his breast and also his neck-guard.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In jealousy I advise also that thou bind him,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And thou shalt make him cower as does a quail.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If thou be fair, where folk are present,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Show thou thy visage and thy apparel;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If thou be ugly, be lavish in thy expenditures;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To get thee friends always work hard;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Be ever in behavior as light as a leaf on a linden tree,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And let him grieve, and weep, and wring his hands, and wail!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; [When ended was the tale of this worthy Clerk,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Our Host said, and swore, "By God's bones,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I would rather than have a barrel of ale<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; My wife at home had heard this legend once!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This is a fine tale for this occasion,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For my purposes, if you knew my will;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But thing that will not be, let it be still."]<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Oh Lord, our Lord, how marvelous thy name <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Is spread in this large world -- said she --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For not only thy precious praise<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Is performed by men of dignity,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But by the mouths of children thy goodness<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Is made known, for on the breast sucking<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Sometimes they show thy praise.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Therefore in praise, as I best know how or can,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Of thee and of the white lily flour<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That bore thee, and is a maid always,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To tell a story I will do my labor;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Not that I may increase her honor,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For she herself is honor and the root<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Of goodness, next to her Son, and soul's remedy.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Oh mother Maiden, Oh generous maiden and Mother!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Oh bush unburned, burning in Moses' sight,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That ravished down from the Deity,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Through thy humility, the Ghost that alighted in thee, <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;By whose power, when he illuminated thy heart,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Father's Wisdom was conceived,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Help me to tell it in thy reverence!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Lady, thy goodness, thy magnificence,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Thy virtue and thy great humility<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There can no tongue express in (the language of) any science;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For sometimes, Lady, ere men pray to thee,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Thou goest before because of thy kindliness,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And gettest us the light, by thy prayer,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To guide us unto thy Son so dear.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;My ability is so weak, Oh blissful Queen,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To declare thy great worthiness<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That I can not sustain the weight;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But as a child of twelve months old, or less,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That can hardly express any word,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Right so I do, and therefore I pray to you,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Guide my song that I shall say of you.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There was in Asia, in a great city,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Among Christian folk a Ghetto,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Sustained by a lord of that country<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For foul usury and shameful profits,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Hateful to Christ and to his company;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And through the street men might ride or go,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For it was free and open at either end.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A little school of Christian folk there stood<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Down at the farther end, in which there were<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A good many children, descended from Christian blood,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That learned in that school year by year<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Such sort of doctrine as men used there,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This is to say, to sing and to read,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As small children do in their childhood.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Among these children was a widow's son,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A little schoolboy, seven years of age,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Whose custom was day by day to go to school,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And in addition, moreover, where he saw the image<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Of Christ's mother, he had the practice,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As was taught to him, to kneel down and say<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;His `Hail Mary,' as he goes by the way.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Thus this widow has taught her little son <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Our blissful Lady, Christ's dear mother,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To worship always, and he forgot it not,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For an innocent child will always quickly learn.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But always, when I think about this matter,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Saint Nicholas stands ever in my mind,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Because he so young did reverence to Christ.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This little child, learning his little book,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As he sat in the school at his primer,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He heard `Gracious (mother) of the Redeemer' being sung,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As children learned their antiphonal hymns;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And as he dared, he drew him nearer and nearer,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And listened always to the words and the notes,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Until he knew the first verse entirely by heart.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He knew not what this Latin meant,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For he was so young and tender of age.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But on one day he did pray his fellow<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To explain to him this song in his language,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Or tell him why this song was in regular use;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This he prayed him to translate and explain<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Very frequently upon his bare knees.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;His fellow, who was older than he,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Answered him thus: "This song, I have heard tell,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Was composed about our generous blissful Lady,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To salute her, and also to pray her <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To be our help and succour when we die.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I can explain no more of this matter.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I learn song; I know but little grammar."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"And is this song composed in reverence<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Of Christ's mother?" said this innocent.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Now, certainly, I will do my best efforts<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To learn it all before Christmas is gone.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Though I for my primer shall be punished<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And shall be beaten thrice in an hour,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I will learn it to honor Our Lady!"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;His fellow privately taught him (as they went) homeward,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;From day to day, until he knew it by heart,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And then he sang it well and boldly,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;From word to word, in harmony with the tune.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Twice a day it passed through his throat,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When he went toward school and homeward;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;On Christ's mother his mind was set.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As I have said, throughout the Ghetto<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This little child, as he came to and fro,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Very merrily then would he sing and cry<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Always `O Gracious (mother) of the Redeemer'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So pierced his heart the sweetness <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Of Christ's mother that, to pray to her,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He can not stop singing by the way.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Our first foe, the serpent Satan,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That has his wasp's nest in Jews' hearts,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Swelled up, and said, "Oh Hebraic people, alas!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Is this a thing that is honorable to you,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That such a boy shall walk as he pleases<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In scorn of you, and sing of such a subject,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Which is against your law's (due) reverence?"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;From thenceforth the Jews have conspired<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To drive this innocent out of this world.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For this they have hired a murderer, <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Who in an alley had a secret place;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And as the child began to pass by,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This cursed Jew seized him, and held him tightly,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And cut his throat, and cast him in a pit.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I say that they threw him in a privy <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Where these Jews purge their entrails.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Oh cursed folk of new Herods, <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;What may your evil intent avail you?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Murder will come out, certainly, it will not fail,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And especially where the honor of God shall spread;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The blood cries out on your cursed deed.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Oh martyr, firmly united to virginity,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Now canst thou sing, following continuously<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The white celestial Lamb -- said she --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Of which the great evangelist, Saint John,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In Pathmos wrote, who says that they that go<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Before this Lamb and sing a song all new,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(Are) those who never, in a carnal way, knew women.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This poor widow waits all that night<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For her little child, but he came not;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For which, as soon as it was daylight,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With face pale from dread and intense thought,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She has sought him at school and elsewhere,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Until finally she got so far as to discover<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That he was last seen in the Ghetto.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With mother's pity enclosed in her breast,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She goes, as if she were half out of her mind,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To every place where she has supposed<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Most likely to find her little child;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And ever on Christ's meek and kind mother<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She cried, and at the last thus she acted:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Among the cursed Jews she sought him.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She asks and she prays piteously<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To every Jew that dwelt in that same place,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To tell her if her child at all went by there.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;They said "nay"; but Jesus of his grace<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Gave it in her thought within a short while<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So that she cried for her son in that place,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Where he was cast in a pit near by.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Oh great God, who performest thy praise<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;By mouths of innocents, lo, here is thy power!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This gem of chastity, this emerald,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And also the bright ruby of martyrdom,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Where he with throat carved lay on his back,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He `Gracious (mother) of the Redeemer' began to sing<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So loud that all the place began to ring.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Christian folk who went through the street<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Came in to wonder upon this thing,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And hastily they sent for the magistrate;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He came quickly without tarrying,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And praises Christ who is king of heaven,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And also his mother, honor of mankind,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And after that he had the Jews bound.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This child with piteous lamentation<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Was taken up, singing his song always,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And with the honor of a great procession<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;They carry him unto the nearby abbey.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;His mother swooning lay by his bier;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The people that were there could hardly <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Bring this new Rachel from his bier.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With torment and with shameful death for each one,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This magistrate had these Jews put to death  <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Who knew of this murder, and that immediately.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He would not tolerate any such cursedness.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Evil shall have what evil will deserve";<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Therefore with wild horses he had them torn apart,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And after that he hanged them by the law.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Upon this bier always lies this innocent<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Before the chief altar, while the masse lasted;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And after that, the abbot with his convent<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Have hurried to bury him very quickly;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And when they cast holy water on him,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Yet spoke this child, when holy water was sprinkled,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And sang `O Gracious (mother) of the Redeemer!'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This abbot, who was a holy man,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As monks are -- or else ought to be --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He began to entreat this young child,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And said, "Oh dear child, I beseech thee,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;By power of the holy Trinity,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Tell me what is thy cause to sing,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Since thy throat is cut as it seems to me?"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"My throat is cut unto my neck boon,"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Said this child, "and in the natural course of events<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I should have dyed, yea, a long time ago.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But Jesus Christ, as you find in books,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Desires that his glory should last and be in mind,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And for the worship of his Mother dear<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Yet can I sing `O Gracious (mother)' loud and clear.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"This well of mercy, Christ's sweet mother,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I loved always, according to my ability,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And when I had to lose my life,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She came to me, and told me to sing<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This anthem truly as I was dying,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As you have heard, and when I had sung,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It seemed to me that she laid a grain upon my tongue.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Therefore I sing, and must sing certainly,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In honor of that blissful generous Maiden<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Until the grain is taken off my tongue;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And after that thus she said to me:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;`My little child, at that time I will fetch thee,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When the grain is taken from thy tongue.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Be not afraid; I will not forsake thee.'"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This holy monk, this abbot, I mean him,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;His tongue pulled out, and took away the grain,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And he gave up the ghost very gently.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And when this abbot had seen this wonder,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;His salt tears trickled down like rain,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And face-down he fell all flat upon the ground,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And still he lay as if he had been bound.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The convent also lay on the pavement<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Weeping, and praising Christ's dear mother,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And after that they rise, and forth are gone,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And took away this martyr from his bier;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And in a tomb of clear marble stones <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;They enclose his sweet little body.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There he is now, God grant us to meet!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Oh young Hugh of Lincoln, slain also<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;By cursed Jews, as it is well known,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For it is but a little while ago,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Pray also for us, we sinful folk unstable,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That of his mercy God so merciful<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Multiply his great mercy on us,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For reverence of his mother Mary. Amen<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This Summoner in his stirrups stood high;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Upon this Friar his heart was so enraged<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That like an aspen leaf he quaked for ire.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Gentlemen," said he, "but one thing I desire;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I you beseech that, of your courtesy,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Since you have heard this false Friar lie,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Now grant me that me I may tell my tale.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This Friar boasts that he knows hell,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And God knows it, that it is little wonder;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Friars and fiends are but little different.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For, by God, you have often times heard tell<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; How a friar was carried off to hell<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In spirit once by a vision;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And as an angel led him up and down,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To show him the pains that were there,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In all the place saw he not a friar;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of other folk he saw enough in woe.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Unto this angel spoke the friar then:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; `Now, sir,' said he, `have friars such a grace<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That none of them shall come to this place?'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; `Yes' said this angel, `many a million!'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And unto Satan he led him down.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; `And now has Satan,' says he, `a tail<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Broader than of a large galleon is the sail.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Hold up thy tail, thou Satan!' said he;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; `Show forth thy ass, and let the friar see<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Where the nest of friars is in this place!'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And before half a furlong way of time (a few minutes),<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Just as bees swarm out from a hive,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Out of the devil's ass there began to rush<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Twenty thousand friars in a crowd,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And throughout hell swarmed all about,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And came back again as fast as they can go,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And in his ass they crept every one.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He clapped his tail again and lay very still.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This friar, when he had looked his fill<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Upon the torments of this sorry place,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His spirit God restored, by his grace,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Unto his body again, and he awoke.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But nonetheless, for fear yet he quaked,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So was the devil's ass always in his mind,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That is his true natural heritage.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; God save you all, except this cursed Friar!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; My prologue will I end in this manner."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Gentlemen, there is in Yorkshire, as I believe,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A marshy country called Holdernesse,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In which there went a licensed beggar about<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To preach, and also to beg, it is no doubt.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And so befell that on a day this friar<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Had preached at a church in his manner,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And specially, above every thing,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Excited he the people in his preaching<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To masses for dead souls, and to give, for God's sake,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The wherewithal that men might holy houses make,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Where divine service is honored,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Not where it is wasted and devoured,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Nor where it needs not to be given,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As to beneficed clergymen, that may live,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thanked be God, in prosperity and abundance.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Masses for souls," said he, "deliver from penance<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Their friends' souls, as well old as young --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Yes, when they are hastily sung,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Not to keep a priest jolly and gay --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He sings not but one masse in a day.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Deliver out," said he, "immediately the souls!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Very hard it is with flesh hook or with awls<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To be clawed, or to burn or bake.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Now speed you hastily, for Christ's sake!"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And when this friar had said all he intended,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With the prayer "who with the father" forth he went his way.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When folk in church had given him what they wished,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He went his way; no longer would he stay.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With satchel and metal-tipped staff, his robe tucked up high,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In every house he began to peer and pry,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And begs meal and cheese, or else grain.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His fellow had a staff tipped with horn,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A pair of tablets all of ivory,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And a writing instrument polished carefully,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And wrote the names always, as he stood,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of all folk that gave him any good thing,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As if he would for them pray.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Give us a bushel of wheat, malt, or rye,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A little cake, or a bit of cheese,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or else what you like, we may not choose;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A God's halfpenny, or a mass penny,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or give us some of your meat, if you have any;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A piece of your woolen cloth, dear lady,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Our sister dear -- lo! Here I write your name --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Bacon or beef, or such thing as you find."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A sturdy rascal went always behind them,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who was their host's man, and bore a sack,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And what men gave them, laid it on his back.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And when he was out at door, immediately<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He planed away the names every one<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That he before had written in his tables;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He served them with tricks and with falsehoods.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Nay, there thou lie, thou Summoner!" said the Friar.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Quiet," said our Host, "for Christ's mother dear!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Tell forth thy tale, and spare it not at al."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "As I may thrive," said this Summoner, "so I shall!"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So long he went, house by house, until he<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Came to a house where he was accustomed to be<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Hospitably received more than in a hundred places.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Sick lay the good man whose the place is;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Bedridden upon a couch low he lay.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "God be here!" said he, "Oh Thomas, friend, good day!"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Said this friar, courteously and soft.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Thomas," said he, "God reward you! Very often<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Have I upon this bench fared full well;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Here have I eaten many a merry meal."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And from the bench he drove away the cat,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And laid down his walking stick and his hat,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And also his satchel, and set him softly down.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His fellow had gone walking into town<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Forth with his knave, into that hostelry<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Where he intended that night to lie.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Oh dear master," said this sick man,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "How have you fared since March began?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I saw you not this fortnight or more."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "God knows," said he, "labored I have very hard,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And especially for thy salvation<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Have I said many a precious prayer,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And for our other friends, God them bless!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I have today been at your church at mass,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And said a sermon insofar as my simple wit allowed --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Not entirely according to the text of holy writ,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For it is hard for you, as I suppose,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And therefore will I teach you all the interpretation.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Interpreting scripture is a glorious thing, certainly,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For letter slays, so we clerks say --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There have I taught them to be charitable,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And spend their goods where it is reasonable;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And there I saw our lady -- Ah! Where is she?"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Yonder in the yard I believe that she be,"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Said this man, "and she will come anon."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Ey, master, welcome are you, by Saint John!"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Said this wife, "How fare you, cordially (I ask)?"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The friar arises up full courteously,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And her embraces in his arms tightly,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And kissed her sweetly, and chirps like a sparrow<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With his lips: "Lady," said he, "right well,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As he who is your servant every bit,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thanked be God, who gave you soul and life!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Yet saw I not this day so fair a wife<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In all the church, as God may save me!"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Yes, God correct my faults, sir," said she.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "At any rate, welcome are you, by my faith!"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Great thanks, lady, this have I found always.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But of your great goodness, by your leave,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I would pray you that you be not annoyed,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I will with Thomas speak a little while.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; These curates are very negligent and slow<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To examine gently a conscience<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In confession; in preaching is my diligence,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And study in Peter's words and in Paul's.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I walk and fish Christian men's souls<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To pay Jesus Christ his proper income;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To spread his word is set all my intention."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Now, by your leave, oh dear sir," said she,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Chide him well, for the Holy Trinity!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He is as angry as a pismire,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Though he have all that he can desire;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Though I cover him at night and make him warm,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And over him lay my leg or my arm,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He groans like our boor, that lies in our sty.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Other pleasure right none of him have I;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I can not please him in any sort of way."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Oh Thomas, I tell you, Thomas! Thomas!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This makes the fiend; this must be amended.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Ire is a thing that high God forbad,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And thereof will I speak a word or two."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Now, master," said the wife, "before I go,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What will you dine? I will go work on that."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Now, lady," said he, "now I tell you without doubt<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Have I of a capon only the liver,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And of your soft breed nothing but a sliver,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And after that a roasted pig's head --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But that I would that no beast for me were dead --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Then had I with you enough plain food.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I am a man who needs little sustenance;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; My spirit has its nourishment in the Bible.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The body is always so ready and accustomed<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To staying awake (to pray), that my stomach is destroyed.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I pray you, lady, that you be not annoyed,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Though I so friendly show you my private affairs.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; By God! I would not tell it but to a few."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Now, sir," said she, "but one word before I go.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; My child is dead within these weeks two,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Soon after you went out of this town."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "His death saw I by revelation,"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Said this friar, "at home in our dormitory.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I dare well say that, before half an hour<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; After his death, I saw him carried up to bliss<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In my vision, as God may guide me!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So did our sacristan and the head of our infirmary,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That have been true friars fifty years;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They may now -- God be thanked of his grace! --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Make their fiftieth anniversary and walk alone.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And up I rose, and all our convent as well,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With many a tear tricking on my cheek,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Without noise or clattering of bells;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Te Deum was our song, and nothing else,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Except that to Christ I said a prayer,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thanking him for his revelation.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For, sir and lady, trust me right well,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Our prayers are more effectual,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And more we see of Christ's secret things,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Than secular folk, although they were kings.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We live in poverty and in abstinence,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And secular folk in riches and expenditures<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of food and drink, and in their foul delight.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We hold this world's lust all in scorn.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Lazar and Dives lived diversely,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And diverse rewards had they thereby.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Whoever will pray, he must fast and be pure,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And fatten his soul, and make his body lean.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We fare as says the apostle; cloth and food<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Suffice us, though they are not full good.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The purity and the fasting of us friars<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Makes that Christ accepts our prayers.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Lo, Moses forty days and forty nights<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Fasted, before the high God of might<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Spoke with him in the mountain of Sinai.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With empty belly, fasting many a day,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Received he the law that was written<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With God's finger; and Elijah, you know well,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In mount Horeb, before he had any speech<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With high God, who is our life's physician,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He fasted long and was in meditation.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Aaron, who had the temple in governance,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And also the other priests every one,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Into the temple when they should go<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To pray for the people and do service,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They would not drink in any sort of way<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Any drink which might make them drunk,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But there in abstinence pray and keep vigil,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Lest they died. Take heed what I say!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Unless they are sober who for the people pray,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Beware that -- I say no more, for it suffices.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Our Lord Jesus, as holy writ devises,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Gave us an example of fasting and prayers.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Therefore we mendicants, we innocent friars,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Are wedded to poverty and chastity,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To charity, humility, and abstinence,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To persecution for righteousness,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To weeping, charity, and purity.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And therefore may you see that our prayers --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I speak of us, we mendicants, we friars --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Are to the high God more acceptable<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Than yours, with your feasts at the table.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; From Paradise first, if I shall not lie,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Was man chased out for his gluttony;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And chaste was man in Paradise, certainly.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "But hearken now, Thomas, what I shall say.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I have no text for it, as I suppose,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But I shall find it in some sort of gloss (interpretation),<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That especially our sweet Lord Jesus<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Spoke this about friars, when he said thus:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; `Blessed are they who are poor in spirit.'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And so forth all the gospel may you see,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Whether it is more like our profession,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or theirs who swim in possessions.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Fie on their pomp and on their gluttony!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And for their ignorance I scorn them.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "I think they are like Jovinian,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Fat as a whale, and waddling like a swan,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As full of wine as a bottle in the pantry.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Their prayer is of full great reverence,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When they for souls say the psalm of David:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Lo, `buf!' they say (belch), `my heart has uttered' (a good word)!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who follows Christ's gospel and his path,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But we who are humble, and chaste, and poor,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Workers of God's word, not mere listeners?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Therefore, just as a hawk upon an upward flight<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Up springs into the' air, right so prayers<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of charitable and chaste busy friars<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Make their upward flight to God's two ears.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thomas, Thomas! As I may ride or walk,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And by that lord who is called Saint Yve,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Were thou not our brother, thou shouldest not thrive.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In our assembly we pray day and night<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To Christ, that he send thee health and strength<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thy body to move with ease hastily."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "God knows," said he, "no thing thereof feel I!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So help me Christ, I in few years,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Have spent upon different sorts of friars<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Very many a pound; yet fare I never the better.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Certainly, I have almost spent all my goods.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Farewell, my gold, for it is all gone!"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The friar answered, "Oh Thomas, dost thou so?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Why do you need to seek various friars?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Why does one who has a perfect physician need<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To seek other physicians in the town?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Your inconstancy is your ruin.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Consider you then me, or else our convent,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To be insufficient to pray for you?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thomas, that trick is not worth a half a farthing.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Your malady is because we have too little.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Ah, give that convent half a quarter (four bushels) oats!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A, give that convent four and twenty groats (four pences)!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A, give that friar a penny, and let him go!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Nay, nay, Thomas, it may in no way be so!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What is a farthing worth divided into twelve?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Lo, each thing that is united in itself<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Is more strong than when it is all scattered.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thomas, by me thou shalt not be flattered;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thou wouldest have our labor all for nothing.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The high God, who all this world has wrought,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Says that the workman is worthy of his hire.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thomas, I do not desire any of your treasure<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For myself, but because all our convent<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To pray for you is always so diligent,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And to build Christ's own church.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thomas, if you want to learn what to do,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Concerning building up of churches you can find<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If it be good in the life of Thomas of India.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You lie here full of anger and of ire,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With which the devil set your heart afire,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And chide here the poor innocent,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Your wife, who is so meek and patient.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And therefore, Thomas, believe me if thou wish,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Strive not with thy wife, for thine own good;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And bear this word away now, by thy faith;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Concerning such thing, lo, what the wise man says:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; `Within thy house be thou no lion;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To thy subjects do no oppression,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Nor make thy acquaintances to flee.'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And, Thomas, yet again I command thee,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Beware of Ire that in thy bosom sleeps;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Beware of the serpent that so slyly creeps<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Under the grass and stings subtly.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Beware, my son, and hearken patiently<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That twenty thousand men have lost their lives<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For striving with their sweethearts and their wives.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Now since you have so holy meek a wife,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Why do you need, Thomas, to make strife?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There is, indeed, no serpent so cruel,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When man treads on his tail, nor half so fierce,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As woman is, when she has become angry;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Vengeance is then all that they desire.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Ire is a sin, one of the greatest of seven,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Abominable unto the God of heaven;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And to himself it is destruction.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This every ignorant vicar or parson<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Can say, how ire engenders homicide.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Ire is, in truth, executor of pride.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I could of ire say so much sorrow,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; My tale should last until to-morrow.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And therefore pray I God both day and night<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; An angry man, God send him little power!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It is great harm and certainly great pity<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To set an angry man in high position.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Once there was an angry potentate,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As says Seneca, who, during his reign,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Upon a day out rode two knights,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And as Fortune would that it were so,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That one of them came home, that other did not.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; At once the knight is brought before the judge,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who said thus, `Thou hast thy fellow slain,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For which I condemn thee to the death, certainly.'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And to another knight commanded he,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; `Go lead him to the death, I charge thee.'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And it happened, as they went by the way<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Toward the place where he should die,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The knight came who men believed had been dead.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Then thought they it would be the best plan<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To lead them both to the judge again.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They said, `Lord, the knight has not slain<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His fellow; here he stands whole and alive.'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; `You shall be dead,' said he, `as I may thrive!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That is to say, both one, and two, and three!'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And to the first knight right thus spoke he,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; `I condemned thee; thou must therefore be dead.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And thou also must of necessity lose thy head,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For thou art the cause why thy fellow dies.'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And to the third knight right thus he says,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; `Thou hast not done what I commanded thee.'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And thus he caused them all three to be slain.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Angry Cambises was also a drunkard,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And it always delighted him to be a scoundrel.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And as it happened, a lord of his household<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who loved virtuous morality<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Said on a day betwixt them two right thus:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "`A lord is lost, if he be vicious;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And drunkenness is also a foul reputation<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of any man, and especially in a lord.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There is full many an eye and many an ear<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Watching a lord, and he knows not where.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For God's love, drink more temperately!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Wine makes man to lose wretchedly<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His mind and also his limbs every one.'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "`The reverse shalt thou see,' said he, `right now,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And prove it by thy own experience,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That wine does to folk no such offence.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There is no wine that deprives me of my power<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of hand nor foot, nor of my eyesight.'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And for spite he drank very much more,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; By a hundred times, than he had done before;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And right away this angry, cursed wretch<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Had this knight's son fetched before him,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Commanding him he should before him stand.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And suddenly he took his bow in hand,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And up the string he pulled to his ear,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And with an arrow he slew the child right there.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; `Now tell me whether I have a sure hand or not?'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Said he; `Is all my power and mind gone?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Has wine bereft me of my eyesight?'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Why should I tell the answer of the knight?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His son was slain; there is no more to say.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Beware, therefore, how you act with lords.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Sing 'I shall please' and `I shall, if I can,'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Unless it be unto a poor man.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To a poor man one should tell his vices,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But not to a lord, though he should go to hell.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Lo angry Cyrus, that Persian,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; How he destroyed the river of Gysen,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Because a horse of his was drowned therein,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When he went to conquer Babylon.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He made it that the river was so small<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That women could wade it everywhere.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Lo, what said he who so well can teach?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; `Be no fellow to an angry man,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Nor with no enraged man walk by the way,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Lest thee repent;' I will no further say.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Now, Thomas, dear brother, leave thine ire;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thou shalt me find as true as is a carpenter's square.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Hold not the devil's knife always at thy heart --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thine anger causes thee all too sorely to suffer --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But show to me all thy confession."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Nay," said the sick man, "by Saint Symoun!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I have been shriven this day by my curate.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I have him told completely all my condition;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It needs no more to speak of it," says he,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Unless I so wish, out of my humility."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Give me then of thy gold, to make our cloister,"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Said he, "for many a mussel and many an oyster,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When other men have been full well at ease,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Have been our food, our cloister to erect.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And yet, God knows, hardly the foundation<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Is finished, nor of our pavement<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There is not a tile yet within our dwelling.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; By God, we owe forty pounds for stones.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Now help, Thomas, for him who despoiled hell of its captives!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For otherwise we must sell our books.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And if you lack our preaching,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Then all the world goes to destruction.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For whoever would rob us from this world,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So save me God, Thomas, by your leave,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He would take the sun out of this world.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For who can teach and work as we know how?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And that is not of recent times," said he,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "But since Elijah was, or Elisha,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Have friars been -- that I find in the records --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In charity, thanked be our Lord!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Now Thomas, help, for holy charity!"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And down at once he set himself on his knee.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This sick man grew well nigh mad for ire;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He wished that the friar had been afire<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With his false dissimulation.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Such a thing as is in my possession,"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Said he, "that can I give, and none other.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You say me thus, that I am your brother?"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Yes, certainly," said the friar, "trust well.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I gave our lady our letter with our seal."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Well now," said he, "and something shall I give<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Unto your holy convent while I live;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And in thy hand thou shalt it have right now,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; On this condition, and none other,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That thou divide it so, my dear brother,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That every friar have as much as the other.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This shalt thou swear on thy religious vows,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Without fraud or quibbling."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "I swear it," said this friar, "by my faith!"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And therewith his hand in his he lays,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Lo, have here my faith; I shall not fail (to keep my word)."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Now then, put in thy hand down by my back,"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Said this man, "and grope well behind.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Beneath my buttock where shalt thou find<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A thing that I have hidden in private."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Ah!" thought this friar, "That shall go with me!"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And down his hand he thrusts to the cleft<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In hope to find there a gift.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And when this sick man felt this friar<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; About his anus grope there and here,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Amid his hand he let the friar a fart;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There is no horse, pulling a cart,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That could have let a fart of such a sound.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The friar up started as does a mad lion --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Ah, false churl," said he, "for God's bones!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This hast thou done on purpose for spite.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thou shalt pay for this fart, if I can (do so)!"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His servants, who heard this affray,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Came leaping in and chased out the friar;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And forth he goes, with a very angry look,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And fetched his fellow, where lay his store.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He looked like a wild boar;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He gnashed his teeth, he was so angry.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; At a rapid pace down to the court he goes,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Where there dwelt a man of greet honor,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To whom he was always confessor.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This worthy man was lord of that village.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This friar came as if he were in a rage,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Where the lord sat eating at his table;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Hardly could the friar speak a word,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Until at the last he said, "God you see!"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This lord did look, and said, "Bless me!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What, friar John, what sort of carrying on is this?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I see well that there is something amiss;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You look as if the wood were full of thieves.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Sit down right now, and tell me what your grief is,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And it shall be amended, if I can."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "I have," said he, "had an insult this day,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; God reward you, down in your village,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That in this world is none so poor a servant boy<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That he would not be nauseated<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; By what I have received in your town.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And yet there grieves me nothing so sore,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As that this old churl with white locks<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Blasphemed has our holy convent as well."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Now, master," said this lord, "I you beseech --"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "No master, sir," said he, "but servant,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Though I have had in school that honor.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; God likes not that `Rabbi' men us call,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Neither in market nor in your large hall."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "No matter," said he, "but tell me all your grief."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Sir," said this friar, "an odious mischief<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This day has happened to my order and me,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And so, consequently, to each degree<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of holy church -- God amend it soon!"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Sir," said the lord, "you know what is to be done.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Do not be angry; you are my confessor;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You are the salt of the earth and the delight.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For God's love, keep your patience!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Tell me your grief." And he straightway told him,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As you have heard before -- you know well what.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The lady of the house always still sat<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Until she had heard what the friar said.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Ey, God's mother," said she, "Blissful maid!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Is there anything else? Tell me faithfully."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "My lady," said he, "how think you of this?"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "How I think" said she. "So help me God,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I say a churl has done a churl's deed.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What should I say? God let him never prosper!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His sick head is full of foolishness;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I consider him in a sort of delirium."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "My lady," said he, "by God, I shall not lie,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Unless I can be avenged in another manner,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I shall defame him wherever I speak,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This false blasphemer who charged me<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To divide that which will not be divided<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Equally to every man, with bad luck (to him)!"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The lord sat still as if he were in a trance,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And in his heart he rolled up and down,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "How had this churl imagination<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To show such a problem to the friar?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Never previously before now heard I of such a matter.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I believe the devil put it in his mind.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In the art of measuring (arithmetic) shall there no man find,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Before this day, such a problem.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who should make a logical proof<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That every man should have equally his part<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As of the sound or odor of a fart?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Oh ingenious, proud churl, I curse his face!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Lo, sirs," said the lord, "with bad luck (to him)!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who ever heard of such a thing before now?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To every man equally? Tell me how.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It is an impossibility; it can not be.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Ey, clever churl, God let him never prosper!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The rumbling of a fart, and every sound,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Is nothing but reverberation of air,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And ever it wastes away little by little.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There is no man can judge, by my faith,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If it were divided equally.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What, lo, my churl, lo, yet how shrewdly<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Unto my confessor to-day he spoke!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I consider him certainly one possessed by a demon!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Now eat your food, and let the churl go play;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Let him go hang himself in the devil's name!"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Now stood the lord's squire at the board,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who carved his meat, and heard word by word<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of all the things which I have told you.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "My lord," said he, "if you be not displeased,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I could tell, for a cloth to make a gown,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To you, sir friar, providing you be not angry,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; How this fart should evenly be divided<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Among your convent, if it pleased me."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Tell," said the lord, "and thou shalt have straightway<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A gown-cloth, by God and by Saint John!"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "My lord," said he, "when the weather is fair,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Without wind or disturbance of air,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Let a cartwheel be brought here into this hall;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But see that it has all its spokes --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Twelve spokes has a cartwheel commonly.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And bring me then twelve friars. Know you why?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For thirteen is a convent, as I believe.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Your confessor here, for his worthiness,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Shall complete the number of his convent.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Then shall they kneel down, all together,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And to every spoke's end, in this manner,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A friar shall very firmly lay his nose.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Your noble confessor -- may God him save! --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Shall hold his nose upright under the nave.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Then shall this churl, with belly stiff and taut<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As any drum, hither be brought;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And set him right on the wheel of this cart,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Upon the nave, and make him let a fart.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And you shall see, on peril of my life (I swear),<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; By proof which is logical,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That equally the sound of it will go,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And also the stink, unto the spokes' ends,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Except that this worthy man, your confessor,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Because he is a man of greet honor,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Shall have the first fruit, as is reasonable.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The noble usage of friars yet is this,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The worthy men of them shall first be served;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And certainly he has it well deserved.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He has to-day taught us so much good<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With preaching in the pulpit where he stood,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That I can affirm, I say for me,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He had the first smell of three farts;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And so would all his convent certainly (agree),<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He bears him so faire and holily."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The lord, the lady, and each man, except the friar,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Said that Jankyn spoke, in this matter,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As well as Euclid or Ptolemy.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Concerning the churl, they said, shrewdness<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And great intelligence made him speak as he spoke;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He is no fool, nor possessed by any demon.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And Jankyn has won a new gown --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; My tale is done; we are almost at town.<BR>
