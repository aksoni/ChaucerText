I trowe men wolde deme it necligenceIf I foryete to tellen the dispenceOf Theseus, that gooth so bisilyTo maken up the lystes roially,That swich a noble theatre as it wasI dar wel seyen in this world ther nas.The circuit a myle was aboute,Walled of stoon, and dyched al withoute.Round was the shap, in manere of compas,Ful of degrees, the heighte of sixty pas,That whan a man was set on o degree,He letted nat his felawe for to see.Estward ther stood a gate of marbul whit,Westward right swich another in the opposit.And shortly to concluden, swich a placeWas noon in erthe, as in so litel space;For in the lond ther was no crafty manThat geometrie or ars-metrike kan,Ne portreyour, ne kervere of ymages,That Theseus ne yaf him mete and wagesThe theatre for to maken and devyse.And for to doon his ryte and sacrifise,He estward hath, upon the gate above,In worshipe of Venus, goddesse of love,Doon make an auter and an oratorie;And on the gate westward, in memorieOf Mars, he maked hath right swich another,That coste largely of gold a fother.And northward, in a touret on the wal,Of alabastre whit and reed coral,An oratorie, riche for to see,In worshipe of Dyane of chastitee,Hath Theseus doon wroght in noble wyse.But yet hadde I foryeten to devyseThe noble kervyng and the portreitures,The shap, the contenaunce, and the figuresThat weren in thise oratories thre.First in the temple of Venus maystow seWroght on the wal, ful pitous to biholde,The broken slepes, and the sikes colde,The sacred teeris, and the waymentynge,The firy strokes of the desiryngeThat loves servantz in this lyf enduren;The othes that hir covenantz assuren;Pleasance and Hope, Desir, Foolhardynesse,Beautee and Youthe, Bauderie, Richesse,Charmes and Force, Lesynges, Flaterye,Despense, Bisynesse, and Jalousye,That wered of yelewe gooldes a gerland,And a cokkow sittynge on hir hand;Festes, instrumentz, caroles, daunces,Lust and array, and alle the circumstauncesOf love, which that I rekned and rekne shal,By ordre weren peynted on the wal,And mo than I kan make of mencioun.For soothly al the mount of Citheroun,Ther Venus hath hir principal dwellynge,Was shewed on the wal in portreyynge,With al the gardyn and the lustynesse.Nat was foryeten the porter, Ydelnesse,Ne Narcisus the faire of yore agon,Ne yet the folye of kyng Salomon,Ne yet the grete strengthe of Ercules --Th'enchauntementz of Medea and Circes --Ne of Turnus, with the hardy fiers corage,The riche Cresus, kaytyf in servage.Thus may ye seen that wysdom ne richesse,Beautee ne sleighte, strengthe ne hardynesse,Ne may with Venus holde champartie,For as hir list the world than may she gye.Lo, alle thise folk so caught were in hir las,Til they for wo ful ofte seyde "allas!"Suffiseth heere ensamples oon or two,And though I koude rekene a thousand mo.The statue of Venus, glorious for to se,Was naked, fletynge in the large see,And fro the navele doun al covered wasWith wawes grene, and brighte as any glas.A citole in hir right hand hadde she,And on hir heed, ful semely for to se,A rose gerland, fressh and wel smellynge;Above hir heed hir dowves flikerynge.Biforn hire stood hir sone Cupido;Upon his shuldres wynges hadde he two,And blynd he was, as it is often seene;A bowe he bar and arwes brighte and kene.Why sholde I noght as wel eek telle yow alThe portreiture that was upon the walWithinne the temple of myghty Mars the rede?Al peynted was the wal, in lengthe and brede,Lyk to the estres of the grisly placeThat highte the grete temple of Mars in Trace,In thilke colde, frosty regiounTher as Mars hath his sovereyn mansioun.First on the wal was peynted a forest,In which ther dwelleth neither man ne best,With knotty, knarry, bareyne trees olde,Of stubbes sharpe and hidouse to biholde,In which ther ran a rumbel in a swough,As though a storm sholde bresten every bough.And dounward from an hille, under a bente,Ther stood the temple of Mars armypotente,Wroght al of burned steel, of which the entreeWas long and streit, and gastly for to se.And therout came a rage and swich a vezeThat it made al the gate for to rese.The northren lyght in at the dores shoon,For wyndowe on the wal ne was ther noon,Thurgh which men myghten any light discerne.The dore was al of adamant eterne,Yclenched overthwart and endelongWith iren tough; and for to make it strong,Every pyler, the temple to sustene,Was tonne-greet, of iren bright and shene.Ther saugh I first the derke ymaginyngOf Felonye, and al the compassyng;The crueel Ire, reed as any gleede;The pykepurs, and eek the pale Drede;The smylere with the knyf under the cloke;The shepne brennynge with the blake smoke;The tresoun of the mordrynge in the bedde;The open werre, with woundes al bibledde;Contek, with blody knyf and sharp manace.Al ful of chirkyng was that sory place.The sleere of hymself yet saugh I ther --His herte-blood hath bathed al his heer --The nayl ydryven in the shode anyght;The colde deeth, with mouth gapyng upright.Amyddes of the temple sat Meschaunce,With disconfort and sory contenaunce.Yet saugh I Woodnesse, laughynge in his rage,Armed Compleint, Outhees, and fiers Outrage;The careyne in the busk, with throte ycorve;A thousand slayn, and nat of qualm ystorve;The tiraunt, with the pray by force yraft;The toun destroyed, ther was no thyng laft.Yet saugh I brent the shippes hoppesteres;The hunte strangled with the wilde beres;The sowe freten the child right in the cradel;The cook yscalded, for al his longe ladel.Noght was foryeten by the infortune of Marte.The cartere overryden with his carte --Under the wheel ful lowe he lay adoun.Ther were also, of Martes divisioun,The barbour, and the bocher, and the smyth,That forgeth sharpe swerdes on his styth.And al above, depeynted in a tour,Saugh I Conquest, sittynge in greet honour,With the sharpe swerd over his heedHangynge by a soutil twynes threed.Depeynted was the slaughtre of Julius,Of grete Nero, and of Antonius;Al be that thilke tyme they were unborn,Yet was hir deth depeynted ther-bifornBy manasynge of Mars, right by figure;So was it shewed in that portreiture,As is depeynted in the sterres aboveWho shal be slayn or elles deed for love.Suffiseth oon ensample in stories olde;I may nat rekene hem alle though I wolde.The statue of Mars upon a carte stoodArmed, and looked grym as he were wood;And over his heed ther shynen two figuresOf sterres, that been cleped in scriptures,That oon Puella, that oother Rubeus --This god of armes was arrayed thus.A wolf ther stood biforn hym at his feetWith eyen rede, and of a man he eet;With soutil pencel was depeynted this storieIn redoutynge of Mars and of his glorie.Now to the temple of Dyane the chaste,As shortly as I kan, I wol me haste,To telle yow al the descripsioun.Depeynted been the walles up and dounOf huntyng and of shamefast chastitee.Ther saugh I how woful Calistopee,Whan that Diane agreved was with here,Was turned from a womman til a bere,And after was she maad the loode-sterre.Thus was it peynted; I kan sey yow no ferre.Hir sone is eek a sterre, as men may see.Ther saugh I Dane, yturned til a tree --I mene nat the goddesse Diane,But Penneus doghter, which that highte Dane.Ther saugh I Attheon an hert ymaked,For vengeaunce that he saugh Diane al naked;I saugh how that his houndes have hym caughtAnd freeten hym, for that they knewe hym naught.Yet peynted was a litel forther moorHow Atthalante hunted the wilde boor,And Meleagre, and many another mo,For which Dyane wroghte hym care and wo.Ther saugh I many another wonder storie,The which me list nat drawen to memorie.This goddesse on an hert ful hye seet,With smale houndes al aboute hir feet,And undernethe hir feet she hadde a moone --Wexynge it was and sholde wanye soone.In gaude grene hir statue clothed was,With bowe in honde and arwes in a cas.Hir eyen caste she ful lowe adounTher Pluto hath his derke regioun.A womman travaillynge was hire biforn;But for hir child so longe was unborn,Ful pitously Lucyna gan she calleAnd seyde, "Help, for thou mayst best of alle!"Wel koude he peynten lifly that it wroghte;With many a floryn he the hewes boghte.Now been thise lystes maad, and Theseus,That at his grete cost arrayed thusThe temples and the theatre every deel,Whan it was doon, hym lyked wonder weel.But stynte I wole of Theseus a lite,And speke of Palamon and of Arcite.The day approcheth of hir retournynge,That everich sholde an hundred knyghtes bryngeThe bataille to darreyne, as I yow tolde.And til Atthenes, hir covenant for to holde,Hath everich of hem broght an hundred knyghtes,Wel armed for the werre at alle rightes.And sikerly ther trowed many a manThat nevere, sithen that the world bigan,As for to speke of knyghthod of hir hond,As fer as God hath maked see or lond,Nas of so fewe so noble a compaignye.For every wight that lovede chivalryeAnd wolde, his thankes, han a passant name,Hath preyed that he myghte been of that game;And wel was hym that therto chosen was,For if ther fille tomorwe swich a cas,Ye knowen wel that every lusty knyghtThat loveth paramours and hath his myght,Were it in Engelond or elleswhere,They wolde, hir thankes, wilnen to be there --To fighte for a lady, benedicitee!It were a lusty sighte for to see.And right so ferden they with Palamon.With hym ther wenten knyghtes many on;Som wol ben armed in an haubergeoun,And in a brestplate and a light gypoun;And som wol have a paire plates large;And som wol have a Pruce sheeld or a targe;Som wol ben armed on his legges weel,And have an ax, and som a mace of steel --Ther is no newe gyse that it nas old.Armed were they, as I have yow told,Everych after his opinioun.Ther maistow seen, comynge with Palamoun,Lygurge hymself, the grete kyng of Trace.Blak was his berd, and manly was his face;The cercles of his eyen in his heed,They gloweden bitwixen yelow and reed,And lik a grifphon looked he aboute,With kempe heeris on his browes stoute;His lymes grete, his brawnes harde and stronge,His shuldres brode, his armes rounde and longe;And as the gyse was in his contree,Ful hye upon a chaar of gold stood he,With foure white boles in the trays.In stede of cote-armure over his harnays,With nayles yelewe and brighte as any gold,He hadde a beres skyn, col-blak for old.His longe heer was kembd bihynde his bak;As any ravenes fethere it shoon for blak;A wrethe of gold, arm-greet, of huge wighte,Upon his heed, set ful of stones brighte,Of fyne rubyes and of dyamauntz.Aboute his chaar ther wenten white alauntz,Twenty and mo, as grete as any steer,To hunten at the leoun or the deer,And folwed hym with mosel faste ybounde,Colered of gold, and tourettes fyled rounde.An hundred lordes hadde he in his route,Armed ful wel, with hertes stierne and stoute.With Arcita, in stories as men fynde,The grete Emetreus, the kyng of Inde,Upon a steede bay trapped in steel,Covered in clooth of gold, dyapred weel,Cam ridynge lyk the god of armes, Mars.His cote-armure was of clooth of TarsCouched with perles white and rounde and grete;His sadel was of brend gold newe ybete;A mantelet upon his shulder hangynge,Bret-ful of rubyes rede as fyr sparklynge;His crispe heer lyk rynges was yronne,And that was yelow, and glytered as the sonne.His nose was heigh, his eyen bright citryn,His lippes rounde, his colour was sangwyn;A fewe frakenes in his face yspreynd,Bitwixen yelow and somdel blak ymeynd;And as a leon he his lookyng caste.Of fyve and twenty yeer his age I caste.His berd was wel bigonne for to sprynge;His voys was as a trompe thonderynge.Upon his heed he wered of laurer greneA gerland, fressh and lusty for to sene.	Upon his hand he bar for his deduytAn egle tame, as any lilye whyt.An hundred lordes hadde he with hym there,Al armed, save hir heddes, in al hir gere,Ful richely in alle maner thynges.For trusteth wel that dukes, erles, kyngesWere gadered in this noble compaignye,For love and for encrees of chivalrye.Aboute this kyng ther ran on every partFul many a tame leon and leopart.And in this wise thise lordes, alle and some,Been on the Sonday to the citee comeAboute pryme, and in the toun alight.This Theseus, this duc, this worthy knyght,Whan he had broght hem into his citee,And inned hem, everich at his degree,He festeth hem, and dooth so greet labourTo esen hem and doon hem al honourThat yet men wenen that no mannes witOf noon estaat ne koude amenden it.The mynstralcye, the service at the feeste,The grete yiftes to the meeste and leeste,The riche array of Theseus paleys,Ne who sat first ne last upon the deys,What ladyes fairest been or best daunsynge,Or which of hem kan dauncen best and synge,Ne who moost felyngly speketh of love;What haukes sitten on the perche above,What houndes liggen on the floor adoun --Of al this make I now no mencioun,But al th' effect; that thynketh me the beste.Now cometh the point, and herkneth if yow leste.The Sonday nyght, er day bigan to sprynge,Whan Palamon the larke herde synge(Although it nere nat day by houres two,Yet the larke sang) and Palamon right thenWith hooly herte and with an heigh corage,He roos to wenden on his pilgrymageUnto the blissful Citherea benign --I mene Venus, honurable and digne.And in hir houre he walketh forth a pasUnto the lystes ther hire temple was,And doun he kneleth, and with humble cheereAnd herte soor he seyde as ye shal heere:"Faireste of faire, O lady myn, Venus,Doughter to Jove and spouse of Vulcanus,Thow gladere of the mount of Citheron,For thilke love thow haddest to Adoon,Have pitee of my bittre teeris smerte,And taak myn humble preyere at thyn herte.Allas! I ne have no langage to telleTh'effectes ne the tormentz of myn helle;Myn herte may myne harmes nat biwreye;I am so confus that I kan noght seyeBut `Mercy, lady bright, that knowest weeleMy thought and seest what harmes that I feele!'Considere al this and rewe upon my soore,As wisly as I shal for everemoore,Emforth my myght, thy trewe servant be,And holden werre alwey with chastitee.That make I myn avow, so ye me helpe!I kepe noght of armes for to yelpe,Ne I ne axe nat tomorwe to have victorie,Ne renoun in this cas, ne veyne glorieOf pris of armes blowen up and doun;But I wolde have fully possessiounOf Emelye, and dye in thy servyse.Fynd thow the manere hou and in what wyse:I recche nat but it may bettre beTo have victorie of hem, or they of me,So that I have my lady in myne armes.For though so be that Mars is god of armes,Youre vertu is so greet in hevene aboveThat if yow list, I shal wel have my love.Thy temple wol I worshipe everemo,And on thyn auter, where I ride or go,I wol doon sacrifice and fires beete.And if ye wol nat so, my lady sweete,Thanne preye I thee, tomorwe with a spereThat Arcita me thurgh the herte bere.Thanne rekke I noght, whan I have lost my lyf,Though that Arcita wynne hire to his wyf.This is th'effect and ende of my preyere:Yif me my love, thow blisful lady deere."Whan the orison was doon of Palamon,His sacrifice he dide, and that anon,Ful pitously, with alle circumstaunces,Al telle I noght as now his observaunces;But atte laste the statue of Venus shook,And made a signe, wherby that he tookThat his preyere accepted was that day.For thogh the signe shewed a delay,Yet wiste he wel that graunted was his boone,And with glad herte he wente hym hoom ful soone.The thridde houre inequal that PalamonBigan to Venus temple for to gon,Up roos the sonne, and up roos EmelyeAnd to the temple of Dyane gan hye.Hir maydens, that she thider with hire ladde,Ful redily with hem the fyr they hadde,Th'encens, the clothes, and the remenant alThat to the sacrifice longen shal;The hornes fulle of meeth, as was the gyse --Ther lakked noght to doon hir sacrifise.Smokynge the temple, ful of clothes faire,This Emelye, with herte debonaire,Hir body wessh with water of a welle.But hou she dide hir ryte I dar nat telle,But it be any thing in general;And yet it were a game to heeren al.To hym that meneth wel it were no charge;But it is good a man been at his large.Hir brighte heer was kembd, untressed al;A coroune of a grene ook cerialUpon hir heed was set ful fair and meete.Two fyres on the auter gan she beete,And dide hir thynges, as men may biholdeIn Stace of Thebes and thise bookes olde.Whan kyndled was the fyr, with pitous cheereUnto Dyane she spak as ye may heere:"O chaste goddesse of the wodes grene,To whom bothe hevene and erthe and see is sene,Queene of the regne of Pluto derk and lowe,Goddesse of maydens, that myn herte hast knoweFul many a yeer, and woost what I desire,As keepe me fro thy vengeaunce and thyn ire,That Attheon aboughte cruelly.Chaste goddesse, wel wostow that IDesire to ben a mayden al my lyf,Ne nevere wol I be no love ne wyf.I am, thow woost, yet of thy compaignye,A mayde, and love huntynge and venerye,And

Palamon, that hath swich love to me,And eek Arcite, that loveth me so soore,This grace I preye thee withoute moore,As sende love and pees bitwixe hem two,And fro me turne awey hir hertes soThat al

wel conserve,And whil I lyve, a mayde I wol thee serve."The fires brenne upon the auter cleere,Whil Emelye was thus in hir preyere.But sodeynly she saugh a sighte queynte,For right anon oon of the fyres queynteAnd quyked agayn, and after that anonThat oother fyr was queynt and al agon;And as it queynte it made a whistelynge,As doon thise wete brondes in hir brennynge,And at the brondes ende out ran anonAs it were blody dropes many oon;For which so soore agast was EmelyeThat she was wel ny mad and gan to crye,For she ne wiste what it signyfied,But oonly for the feere thus hath she cried,And weep that it was pitee for to heere.And therwithal Dyane gan appeere,With bowe in honde, right as an hunteresse,And seyde, "Doghter, stynt thyn hevynesse.Among the goddes hye it is affermed,And by eterne word writen and confermed,Thou shalt ben wedded unto oon of thoThat han for thee so muchel care and wo,But unto which of hem I may nat telle.Farwel, for I ne may no lenger dwelle.The fires which that on myn auter brenneShulle thee declaren, er that thou go henne,Thyn aventure of love, as in this cas."And with that word, the arwes in the caasOf the goddesse clateren faste and rynge,And forth she wente and made a vanysshynge;For which this Emelye astoned was,And seyde, "What amounteth this, allas?I putte me in thy proteccioun,Dyane, and in thy disposicioun."And hoom she goth anon the nexte weye.This is th'effect; ther is namoore to seye.The nexte houre of Mars folwynge this,Arcite unto the temple walked isOf fierse Mars to doon his sacrifise,With alle the rytes of his payen wyse.With pitous herte and heigh devocioun,Right thus to Mars he seyde his orisoun:"O stronge god, that in the regnes coldeOf Trace honoured art and lord yholde,And hast in every regne and every

stynt of Arcita the stronge,The rynges on the temple dore that honge,And eek the dores, clatereden ful faste,Of which Arcita somwhat hym agaste.The fyres brenden upon the auter brighteThat it gan al

god armypotente,That Juppiter was bisy it to stente,Til that the pale Saturnus the colde,That knew so manye of aventures olde,Foond in his olde experience an artThat he ful soone hath plesed every

for which that I bygan.Whan that Aprill with his shoures sooteThe droghte of March hath perced to the roote,And bathed every veyne in swich licourOf which vertu engendred is the flour;Whan Zephirus eek with his sweete breethInspired hath in every holt and heethThe tendre croppes, and the yonge sonneHath in the Ram his half cours yronne,And smale foweles maken melodye,That slepen al the nyght with open ye(So priketh hem Nature in hir corages),Thanne longen folk to goon on pilgrimages,And palmeres for to seken straunge strondes,To ferne halwes, kowthe in sondry londes;And specially from every shires endeOf Engelond to Caunterbury they wende,The hooly blisful martir for to seke,That hem hath holpen whan that they were seeke.Bifil that in that seson on a day,In Southwerk at the Tabard as I layRedy to wenden on my pilgrymageTo Caunterbury with ful devout corage,At nyght was come into that hostelryeWel nyne and twenty in a compaignyeOf sondry folk, by aventure yfalleIn felaweshipe, and pilgrimes were they alle,That toward Caunterbury wolden ryde.The chambres and the stables weren wyde,And wel we weren esed atte beste.And shortly, whan the sonne was to reste,So hadde I spoken with hem everichonThat I was of hir felaweshipe anon,And made forward erly for to ryse,To take oure wey ther as I yow devyse.But nathelees, whil I have tyme and space,Er that I ferther in this tale pace,Me thynketh it acordaunt to resounTo telle yow al the condiciounOf ech of hem, so as it semed me,And whiche they weren, and of what degree,And eek in what array that they were inne;And at a knyght than wol I first bigynne.A KNYGHT ther was, and that a worthy man,That fro the tyme that he first biganTo riden out, he loved chivalrie,Trouthe and honour, fredom and curteisie.Ful worthy was he in his lordes werre,And therto hadde he riden, no man ferre,As wel in cristendom as in hethenesse,And evere honoured for his worthynesse;At Alisaundre he was whan it was wonne.Ful ofte tyme he hadde the bord bigonneAboven alle nacions in Pruce;In Lettow hadde he reysed and in Ruce,No Cristen man so ofte of his degree.In Gernade at the seege eek hadde he beOf Algezir, and riden in Belmarye.At Lyeys was he and at Satalye,Whan they were wonne, and in the Grete SeeAt many a noble armee hadde he be.At mortal batailles hadde he been fiftene,And foughten for oure feith at TramysseneIn lystes thries, and ay slayn his foo.This ilke worthy knyght hadde been alsoSomtyme with the lord of PalatyeAgayn another hethen in Turkye;And everemoore he hadde a sovereyn prys.And though that he were worthy, he was wys,And of his port as meeke as is a mayde.He nevere yet no vileynye ne saydeIn al his lyf unto no maner wight.He was a verray, parfit gentil knyght.But for to tellen yow of his array,His hors were goode, but he was nat gay.Of fustian he wered a gyponAl bismotered with his habergeon,For he was late ycome from his viage,And wente for to doon his pilgrymage.With hym ther was his sone, a yong SQUIER,A lovyere and a lusty bacheler,With lokkes crulle as they were leyd in presse.Of twenty yeer of age he was, I gesse.Of his stature he was of evene lengthe,And wonderly delyvere, and of greet strengthe.And he hadde been somtyme in chyvachieIn Flaundres, in Artoys, and Pycardie,And born hym weel, as of so litel space,In hope to stonden in his lady grace.Embrouded was he, as it were a meedeAl ful of fresshe floures, whyte and reede.Syngynge he was, or floytynge, al the day;He was as fressh as is the month of May.Short was his gowne, with sleves longe and wyde.Wel koude he sitte on hors and faire ryde.He koude songes make and wel endite,Juste and eek daunce, and weel purtreye and write.So hoote he lovede that by nyghtertaleHe sleep namoore than dooth a nyghtyngale.Curteis he was, lowely, and servysable,And carf biforn his fader at the table.A YEMAN hadde he and servantz namoAt that tyme, for hym liste ride so,And he was clad in cote and hood of grene.A sheef of pecok arwes, bright and kene,Under his belt he bar ful thriftily(Wel koude he dresse his takel yemanly;His arwes drouped noght with fetheres lowe),And in his hand he baar a myghty bowe.A not heed hadde he, with a broun visage.Of wodecraft wel koude he al the usage.Upon his arm he baar a gay bracer,And by his syde a swerd and a bokeler,And on that oother syde a gay daggereHarneised wel and sharp as point of spere;A Cristopher on his brest of silver sheene.An horn he bar, the bawdryk was of grene;A forster was he, soothly, as I gesse.Ther was also a Nonne, a PRIORESSE,That of hir smylyng was ful symple and coy;Hire gretteste ooth was but by Seinte Loy;And she was cleped madame Eglentyne.Ful weel she soong the service dyvyne,Entuned in hir nose ful semely;And Frenssh she spak ful faire and fetisly,After the scole of Stratford atte Bowe,For Frenssh of Parys was to hire unknowe.At mete wel ytaught was she with alle;She leet no morsel from hir lippes falle,Ne wette hir fyngres in hir sauce depe;Wel koude she carie a morsel and wel kepeThat no drope ne fille upon hire brest.In curteisie was set ful muchel hir lest.Hir over-lippe wyped she so cleneThat in hir coppe ther was no ferthyng seneOf grece, whan she dronken hadde hir draughte.Ful semely after hir mete she raughte.And sikerly she was of greet desport,And ful plesaunt, and amyable of port,And peyned hire to countrefete cheereOf court, and to been estatlich of manere,And to ben holden digne of reverence.But for to speken of hire conscience,She was so charitable and so pitousShe wolde wepe, if that she saugh a mousKaught in a trappe, if it were deed or bledde.Of smale houndes hadde she that she feddeWith rosted flessh, or milk and wastel-breed.But soore wepte she if oon of hem were deed,Or if men smoot it with a yerde smerte;And al was conscience and tendre herte.Ful semyly hir wympul pynched was,Hir nose tretys, hir eyen greye as glas,Hir mouth ful smal, and therto softe and reed.But sikerly she hadde a fair forheed;It was almoost a spanne brood, I trowe;For, hardily, she was nat undergrowe.Ful fetys was hir cloke, as I was war.Of smal coral aboute hire arm she barA peire of bedes, gauded al with grene,And theron heng a brooch of gold ful sheene,On which ther was first write a crowned A,And after Amor vincit omnia.Another NONNE with hire hadde she,That was hir chapeleyne, and preestes thre.A MONK ther was, a fair for the maistrie,An outridere, that lovede venerie,A manly man, to been an abbot able.Ful many a deyntee hors hadde he in stable,And whan he rood, men myghte his brydel heereGynglen in a whistlynge wynd als cleereAnd eek as loude as dooth the chapel belleTher as this lord was kepere of the celle.The reule of Seint Maure or of Seint Beneit --By cause that it was old and somdel streitThis ilke Monk leet olde thynges pace,And heeld after the newe world the space.He yaf nat of that text a pulled hen,That seith that hunters ben nat hooly men,Ne that a monk, whan he is recchelees,Is likned til a fissh that is waterlees --This is to seyn, a monk out of his cloystre.But thilke text heeld he nat worth an oystre;And I seyde his opinion was good.What sholde he studie and make hymselven wood,Upon a book in cloystre alwey to poure,Or swynken with his handes, and laboure,As Austyn bit? How shal the world be served?Lat Austyn have his swynk to hym reserved!Therfore he was a prikasour aright:Grehoundes he hadde as swift as fowel in flight;Of prikyng and of huntyng for the hareWas al his lust, for no cost wolde he spare.I seigh his sleves purfiled at the hondWith grys, and that the fyneste of a lond;And for to festne his hood under his chyn,He hadde of gold ywroght a ful curious pyn;A love-knotte in the gretter ende ther was.His heed was balled, that shoon as any glas,And eek his face, as he hadde been enoynt.He was a lord ful fat and in good poynt;His eyen stepe, and rollynge in his heed,That stemed as a forneys of a leed;His bootes souple, his hors in greet estaat.Now certeinly he was a fair prelaat;He was nat pale as a forpyned goost.A fat swan loved he best of any roost.His palfrey was as broun as is a berye.A FRERE ther was, a wantowne and a merye,A lymytour, a ful solempne man.In alle the ordres foure is noon that kanSo muchel of daliaunce and fair langage.He hadde maad ful many a mariageOf yonge wommen at his owene cost.Unto his ordre he was a noble post.Ful wel biloved and famulier was heWith frankeleyns over al in his contree,And eek with worthy wommen of the toun;For he hadde power of confessioun,As seyde hymself, moore than a curat,For of his ordre he was licenciat.Ful swetely herde he confessioun,And plesaunt was his absolucioun:He was an esy man to yeve penaunce,Ther as he wiste to have a good pitaunce.For unto a povre ordre for to yiveIs signe that a man is wel yshryve;For if he yaf, he dorste make avaunt,He wiste that a man was repentaunt;For many a man so hard is of his herte,He may nat wepe, althogh hym soore smerte.Therfore in stede of wepynge and preyeresMen moote yeve silver to the povre freres.His typet was ay farsed ful of knyvesAnd pynnes, for to yeven faire wyves.And certeinly he hadde a murye note:Wel koude he synge and pleyen on a rote;Of yeddynges he baar outrely the pris.His nekke whit was as the flour-de-lys;Therto he strong was as a champioun.He knew the tavernes wel in every tounAnd everich hostiler and tappestereBet than a lazar or a beggestere,For unto swich a worthy man as heAcorded nat, as by his facultee,To have with sike lazars aqueyntaunce.It is nat honest; it may nat avaunce,For to deelen with no swich poraille,But al with riche and selleres of vitaille.And over al, ther as profit sholde arise,Curteis he was and lowely of servyse;Ther nas no man nowher so vertuous.He was the beste beggere in his hous;[And yaf a certeyn ferme for the graunt; Noon of his bretheren cam ther in his haunt;] For thogh a wydwe hadde noght a sho,So plesaunt was his "In principio,"Yet wolde he have a ferthyng, er he wente.His purchas was wel bettre than his rente.And rage he koude, as it were right a whelp.In love-dayes ther koude he muchel help,For ther he was nat lyk a cloystererWith a thredbare cope, as is a povre scoler,But he was lyk a maister or a pope.Of double worstede was his semycope,That rounded as a belle out of the presse.Somwhat he lipsed, for his wantownesse,To make his Englissh sweete upon his tonge;And in his harpyng, whan that he hadde songe,His eyen twynkled in his heed aryghtAs doon the sterres in the frosty nyght.This worthy lymytour was cleped Huberd.A MARCHANT was ther with a forked berd,In mottelee, and hye on horse he sat;Upon his heed a Flaundryssh bever hat,His bootes clasped faire and fetisly.His resons he spak ful solempnely,Sownynge alwey th' encrees of his wynnyng.He wolde the see were kept for any thyngBitwixe Middelburgh and Orewelle.Wel koude he in eschaunge sheeldes selle.This worthy man ful wel his wit bisette:Ther wiste no wight that he was in dette,So estatly was he of his governaunceWith his bargaynes and with his chevyssaunce.For sothe he was a worthy man with alle,But, sooth to seyn, I noot how men hym calle.A CLERK ther was of Oxenford also,That unto logyk hadde longe ygo.As leene was his hors as is a rake,And he nas nat right fat, I undertake,But looked holwe, and therto sobrely.Ful thredbare was his overeste courtepy,For he hadde geten hym yet no benefice,Ne was so worldly for to have office.For hym was levere have at his beddes heedTwenty bookes, clad in blak or reed,Of Aristotle and his philosophieThan robes riche, or fithele, or gay sautrie.But al be that he was a philosophre,Yet hadde he but litel gold in cofre;But al that he myghte of his freendes hente,On bookes and on lernynge he it spente,And bisily gan for the soules preyeOf hem that yaf hym wherwith to scoleye.Of studie took he moost cure and moost heede.Noght o word spak he moore than was neede,And that was seyd in forme and reverence,And short and quyk and ful of hy sentence;Sownynge in moral vertu was his speche,And gladly wolde he lerne and gladly teche.A SERGEANT OF THE LAWE, war and wys,That often hadde been at the Parvys,Ther was also, ful riche of excellence.Discreet he was and of greet reverence --He semed swich, his wordes weren so wise.Justice he was ful often in assise,By patente and by pleyn commissioun.For his science and for his heigh renoun,Of fees and robes hadde he many oon.So greet a purchasour was nowher noon:Al was fee symple to hym in effect;His purchasyng myghte nat been infect.Nowher so bisy a man as he ther nas,And yet he semed bisier than he was.In termes hadde he caas and doomes alleThat from the tyme of kyng William were falle.Therto he koude endite and make a thyng,Ther koude no wight pynche at his writyng;And every statut koude he pleyn by rote.He rood but hoomly in a medlee cote,Girt with a ceint of silk, with barres smale;Of his array telle I no lenger tale.A FRANKELEYN was in his compaignye.Whit was his berd as is the dayesye;Of his complexioun he was sangwyn.Wel loved he by the morwe a sop in wyn;To lyven in delit was evere his wone,For he was Epicurus owene sone,That heeld opinioun that pleyn delitWas verray felicitee parfit.An housholdere, and that a greet, was he;Seint Julian he was in his contree.His breed, his ale, was alweys after oon;A bettre envyned man was nowher noon.Withoute bake mete was nevere his hous,Of fissh and flessh, and that so plentevousIt snewed in his hous of mete and drynke;Of alle deyntees that men koude thynke,After the sondry sesons of the yeer,So chaunged he his mete and his soper.Ful many a fat partrich hadde he in muwe,And many a breem and many a luce in stuwe.Wo was his cook but if his sauce werePoynaunt and sharp, and redy al his geere.His table dormant in his halle alwayStood redy covered al the longe day.At sessiouns ther was he lord and sire;Ful ofte tyme he was knyght of the shire.An anlaas and a gipser al of silkHeeng at his girdel, whit as morne milk.A shirreve hadde he been, and a contour.Was nowher swich a worthy vavasour.AN HABERDASSHERE and a CARPENTER,A WEBBE, a DYERE, and a TAPYCER --And they were clothed alle in o lyvereeOf a solempne and a greet fraternitee.Ful fressh and newe hir geere apiked was;Hir knyves were chaped noght with brasBut al with silver, wroght ful clene and weel,Hire girdles and hir pouches everydeel.Wel semed ech of hem a fair burgeysTo sitten in a yeldehalle on a deys.Everich, for the wisdom that he kan,Was shaply for to been an alderman.For catel hadde they ynogh and rente,And eek hir wyves wolde it wel assente;And elles certeyn were they to blame.It is ful fair to been ycleped "madame,"And goon to vigilies al bifore,And have a mantel roialliche ybore.A COOK they hadde with hem for the nonesTo boille the chiknes with the marybones,And poudre-marchant tart and galyngale.Wel koude he knowe a draughte of Londoun ale.He koude rooste, and sethe, and broille, and frye,Maken mortreux, and wel bake a pye.But greet harm was it, as it thoughte me,That on his shyne a mormal hadde he.For blankmanger, that made he with the beste.A SHIPMAN was ther, wonynge fer by weste;For aught I woot, he was of Dertemouthe.He rood upon a rouncy, as he kouthe,In a gowne of faldyng to the knee.A daggere hangynge on a laas hadde heAboute his nekke, under his arm adoun.The hoote somer hadde maad his hewe al broun;And certeinly he was a good felawe.Ful many a draughte of wyn had he ydraweFro Burdeux-ward, whil that the chapman sleep.Of nyce conscience took he no keep.If that he faught and hadde the hyer hond,By water he sente hem hoom to every lond.But of his craft to rekene wel his tydes,His stremes, and his daungers hym bisides,His herberwe, and his moone, his lodemenage,Ther nas noon swich from Hulle to Cartage.Hardy he was and wys to undertake;With many a tempest hadde his berd been shake.He knew alle the havenes, as they were,Fro Gootlond to the cape of Fynystere,And every cryke in Britaigne and in Spayne.His barge ycleped was the Maudelayne.With us ther was a DOCTOUR OF PHISIK;In al this world ne was ther noon hym lik,To speke of phisik and of surgerye,For he was grounded in astronomye.He kepte his pacient a ful greet deelIn houres by his magyk natureel.Wel koude he fortunen the ascendentOf his ymages for his pacient.He knew the cause of everich maladye,Were it of hoot, or coold, or moyste, or drye,And where they engendred, and of what humour.He was a verray, parfit praktisour:The cause yknowe, and of his harm the roote,Anon he yaf the sike man his boote.Ful redy hadde he his apothecariesTo sende hym drogges and his letuaries,For ech of hem made oother for to wynne --Hir frendshipe nas nat newe to bigynne.Wel knew he the olde Esculapius,And Deyscorides, and eek Rufus,Olde Ypocras, Haly, and Galyen,Serapion, Razis, and Avycen,Averrois, Damascien, and Constantyn,Bernard, and Gatesden, and Gilbertyn.Of his diete mesurable was he,For it was of no superfluitee,But of greet norissyng and digestible.His studie was but litel on the Bible.In sangwyn and in pers he clad was al,Lyned with taffata and with sendal.And yet he was but esy of dispence;He kepte that he wan in pestilence.For gold in phisik is a cordial,Therefore he lovede gold in special.A good WIF was ther OF biside BATHE,But she was somdel deef, and that was scathe.Of clooth-makyng she hadde swich an hauntShe passed hem of Ypres and of Gaunt.In al the parisshe wif ne was ther noonThat to the offrynge bifore hire sholde goon;And if ther dide, certeyn so wrooth was sheThat she was out of alle charitee.Hir coverchiefs ful fyne weren of ground;I dorste swere they weyeden ten poundThat on a Sonday weren upon hir heed.Hir hosen weren of fyn scarlet reed,Ful streite yteyd, and shoes ful moyste and newe.Boold was hir face, and fair, and reed of hewe.She was a worthy womman al hir lyve:Housbondes at chirche dore she hadde fyve,Withouten oother compaignye in youthe --But thereof nedeth nat to speke as nowthe.And thries hadde she been at Jerusalem;She hadde passed many a straunge strem;At Rome she hadde been, and at Boloigne,In Galice at Seint-Jame, and at Coloigne.She koude muchel of wandrynge by the weye.Gat-tothed was she, soothly for to seye.Upon an amblere esily she sat,Ywympled wel, and on hir heed an hatAs brood as is a bokeler or a targe;A foot-mantel aboute hir hipes large,And on hir feet a paire of spores sharpe.In felaweshipe wel koude she laughe and carpe.Of remedies of love she knew per chaunce,For she koude of that art the olde daunce.A good man was ther of religioun,And was a povre PERSOUN OF A TOUN,But riche he was of hooly thoght and werk.He was also a lerned man, a clerk,That Cristes gospel trewely wolde preche;His parisshens devoutly wolde he teche.Benygne he was, and wonder diligent,And in adversitee ful pacient,And swich he was ypreved ofte sithes.Ful looth were hym to cursen for his tithes,But rather wolde he yeven, out of doute,Unto his povre parisshens abouteOf his offryng and eek of his substaunce.He koude in litel thyng have suffisaunce.Wyd was his parisshe, and houses fer asonder,But he ne lefte nat, for reyn ne thonder,In siknesse nor in meschief to visiteThe ferreste in his parisshe, muche and lite,Upon his feet, and in his hand a staf.This noble ensample to his sheep he yaf,That first he wroghte, and afterward he taughte.Out of the gospel he tho wordes caughte,And this figure he added eek therto,That if gold ruste, what shal iren do?For if a preest be foul, on whom we truste,No wonder is a lewed man to ruste;And shame it is, if a prest take keep,A shiten shepherde and a clene sheep.Wel oghte a preest ensample for to yive,By his clennesse, how that his sheep sholde lyve.He sette nat his benefice to hyreAnd leet his sheep encombred in the myreAnd ran to Londoun unto Seinte PoulesTo seken hym a chaunterie for soules,Or with a bretherhed to been withholde;But dwelte at hoom, and kepte wel his folde,So that the wolf ne made it nat myscarie;He was a shepherde and noght a mercenarie.And though he hooly were and vertuous,He was to synful men nat despitous,Ne of his speche daungerous ne digne,But in his techyng discreet and benygne.To drawen folk to hevene by fairnesse,By good ensample, this was his bisynesse.But it were any persone obstinat,What so he were, of heigh or lough estat,Hym wolde he snybben sharply for the nonys.A bettre preest I trowe that nowher noon ys.He waited after no pompe and reverence,Ne maked him a spiced conscience,But Cristes loore and his apostles twelveHe taughte; but first he folwed it hymselve.With hym ther was a PLOWMAN, was his brother,That hadde ylad of dong ful many a fother;A trewe swynkere and a good was he,Lyvynge in pees and parfit charitee.God loved he best with al his hoole herteAt alle tymes, thogh him gamed or smerte,And thanne his neighebor right as hymselve.He wolde thresshe, and therto dyke and delve,For Cristes sake, for every povre wight,Withouten hire, if it lay in his myght.His tithes payde he ful faire and wel,Bothe of his propre swynk and his catel.In a tabard he rood upon a mere.Ther was also a REVE, and a MILLERE,A SOMNOUR, and a PARDONER also,A MAUNCIPLE, and myself -- ther were namo.The MILLERE was a stout carl for the nones;Ful byg he was of brawn, and eek of bones.That proved wel, for over al ther he cam,At wrastlynge he wolde have alwey the ram.He was short-sholdred, brood, a thikke knarre;Ther was no dore that he nolde heve of harre,Or breke it at a rennyng with his heed.His berd as any sowe or fox was reed,And therto brood, as though it were a spade.Upon the cop right of his nose he hadeA werte, and theron stood a toft of herys,Reed as the brustles of a sowes erys;His nosethirles blake were and wyde.A swerd and a bokeler bar he by his syde.His mouth as greet was as a greet forneys.He was a janglere and a goliardeys,And that was moost of synne and harlotries.Wel koude he stelen corn and tollen thries;And yet he hadde a thombe of gold, pardee.A whit cote and a blew hood wered he.A baggepipe wel koude he blowe and sowne,And therwithal he broghte us out of towne.A gentil MAUNCIPLE was ther of a temple,Of which achatours myghte take exempleFor to be wise in byynge of vitaille;For wheither that he payde or took by taille,Algate he wayted so in his achaatThat he was ay biforn and in good staat.Now is nat that of God a ful fair graceThat swich a lewed mannes wit shal paceThe wisdom of an heep of lerned men?Of maistres hadde he mo than thries ten,That weren of lawe expert and curious,Of which ther were a duszeyne in that housWorthy to been stywardes of rente and londOf any lord that is in Engelond,To make hym lyve by his propre goodIn honour dettelees (but if he were wood),Or lyve as scarsly as hym list desire;And able for to helpen al a shireIn any caas that myghte falle or happe.And yet this Manciple sette hir aller cappe.The REVE was a sclendre colerik man.His berd was shave as ny as ever he kan;His heer was by his erys ful round yshorn;His top was dokked lyk a preest biforn.Ful longe were his legges and ful lene,Ylyk a staf; ther was no calf ysene.Wel koude he kepe a gerner and a bynne;Ther was noon auditour koude on him wynne.Wel wiste he by the droghte and by the reynThe yeldynge of his seed and of his greyn.His lordes sheep, his neet, his dayerye,His swyn, his hors, his stoor, and his pultryeWas hoolly in this Reves governynge,And by his covenant yaf the rekenynge,Syn that his lord was twenty yeer of age.Ther koude no man brynge hym in arrerage.Ther nas baillif, ne hierde, nor oother hyne,That he ne knew his sleighte and his covyne;They were adrad of hym as of the deeth.His wonyng was ful faire upon an heeth;With grene trees yshadwed was his place.He koude bettre than his lord purchace.Ful riche he was astored pryvely.His lord wel koude he plesen subtilly,To yeve and lene hym of his owene good,And have a thank, and yet a cote and hood.In youthe he hadde lerned a good myster:He was a wel good wrighte, a carpenter.This Reve sat upon a ful good stotThat was al pomely grey and highte Scot.A long surcote of pers upon he hade,And by his syde he baar a rusty blade.Of Northfolk was this Reve of which I telle,Biside a toun men clepen Baldeswelle.Tukked he was as is a frere aboute,And evere he rood the hyndreste of oure route.A SOMONOUR was ther with us in that place,That hadde a fyr-reed cherubynnes face,For saucefleem he was, with eyen narwe.As hoot he was and lecherous as a sparwe,With scalled browes blake and piled berd.Of his visage children were aferd.Ther nas quyk-silver, lytarge, ne brymstoon,Boras, ceruce, ne oille of tartre noon,Ne oynement that wolde clense and byte,That hym myghte helpen of his whelkes white,Nor of the knobbes sittynge on his chekes.Wel loved he garleek, oynons, and eek lekes,And for to drynken strong wyn, reed as blood;Thanne wolde he speke and crie as he were wood.And whan that he wel dronken hadde the wyn,Thanne wolde he speke no word but Latyn.A fewe termes hadde he, two or thre,That he had lerned out of som decree --No wonder is, he herde it al the day;And eek ye knowen wel how that a jayKan clepen "Watte" as wel as kan the pope.But whoso koude in oother thyng hym grope,Thanne hadde he spent al his philosophie;Ay "Questio quid iuris" wolde he crie.He was a gentil harlot and a kynde;A bettre felawe sholde men noght fynde.He wolde suffre for a quart of wynA good felawe to have his concubynA twelf month, and excuse hym atte fulle;Ful prively a fynch eek koude he pulle.And if he foond owher a good felawe,He wolde techen him to have noon aweIn swich caas of the ercedekenes curs,But if a mannes soule were in his purs;For in his purs he sholde ypunysshed be."Purs is the ercedekenes helle," seyde he.But wel I woot he lyed right in dede;Of cursyng oghte ech gilty man him drede,For curs wol slee right as assoillyng savith,And also war hym of a Significavit.In daunger hadde he at his owene giseThe yonge girles of the diocise,And knew hir conseil, and was al hir reed.A gerland hadde he set upon his heed,As greet as it were for an ale-stake.A bokeleer hadde he maad hym of a cake.With hym ther rood a gentil PARDONEROf Rouncivale, his freend and his compeer,That streight was comen fro the court of Rome.Ful loude he soong "Com hider, love, to me!"This Somonour bar to hym a stif burdoun;Was nevere trompe of half so greet a soun.This Pardoner hadde heer as yelow as wex,But smothe it heeng as dooth a strike of flex;By ounces henge his lokkes that he hadde,And therwith he his shuldres overspradde;But thynne it lay, by colpons oon and oon.But hood, for jolitee, wered he noon,For it was trussed up in his walet.Hym thoughte he rood al of the newe jet;Dischevelee, save his cappe, he rood al bare.Swiche glarynge eyen hadde he as an hare.A vernycle hadde he sowed upon his cappe.His walet, biforn hym in his lappe,Bretful of pardoun comen from Rome al hoot.A voys he hadde as smal as hath a goot.No berd hadde he, ne nevere sholde have;As smothe it was as it were late shave.I trowe he were a geldyng or a mare.But of his craft, fro Berwyk into WareNe was ther swich another pardoner.For in his male he hadde a pilwe-beer,Which that he seyde was Oure Lady veyl;He seyde he hadde a gobet of the seylThat Seint Peter hadde, whan that he wenteUpon the see, til Jhesu Crist hym hente.He hadde a croys of latoun ful of stones,And in a glas he hadde pigges bones.But with thise relikes, whan that he fondA povre person dwellynge upon lond,Upon a day he gat hym moore moneyeThan that the person gat in monthes tweye;And thus, with feyned flaterye and japes,He made the person and the peple his apes.But trewely to tellen atte laste,He was in chirche a noble ecclesiaste.Wel koude he rede a lessoun or a storie,But alderbest he song an offertorie;For wel he wiste, whan that song was songe,He moste preche and wel affile his tongeTo wynne silver, as he ful wel koude;Therefore he song the murierly and loude.Now have I toold you soothly, in a clause,Th' estaat, th' array, the nombre, and eek the causeWhy that assembled was this compaignyeIn Southwerk at this gentil hostelryeThat highte the Tabard, faste by the Belle.But now is tyme to yow for to telleHow that we baren us that ilke nyght,Whan we were in that hostelrie alyght;And after wol I telle of our viageAnd al the remenaunt of oure pilgrimage.But first I pray yow, of youre curteisye,That ye n' arette it nat my vileynye,Thogh that I pleynly speke in this mateere,To telle yow hir wordes and hir cheere,Ne thogh I speke hir wordes proprely.For this ye knowen al so wel as I:Whoso shal telle a tale after a man,He moot reherce as ny as evere he kanEverich a word, if it be in his charge,Al speke he never so rudeliche and large,Or ellis he moot telle his tale untrewe,Or feyne thyng, or fynde wordes newe.He may nat spare, althogh he were his brother;He moot as wel seye o word as

tellen us,Ther was a duc that highte Theseus;Of Atthenes he was lord and governour,And in his tyme swich a conquerourThat gretter was ther noon under the sonne.Ful many a riche contree hadde he wonne;What with his wysdom and his chivalrie,He conquered al the regne of Femenye,That whilom was ycleped Scithia,And weddede the queene Ypolita,And broghte hire hoom with hym in his contreeWith muchel glorie and greet solempnytee,And eek hir yonge suster Emelye.And thus with victorie and with melodyeLete I this noble duc to Atthenes ryde,And al his hoost in armes hym bisyde.And certes, if it nere to long to heere,I wolde have toold yow fully the manereHow wonnen was the regne of FemenyeBy Theseus and by his chivalrye;And of the grete bataille for the nonesBitwixen Atthenes and Amazones;And how asseged was Ypolita,The faire, hardy queene of Scithia;And of the feste that was at hir weddynge,And of the tempest at hir hoom-comynge;But al that thyng I moot as now forbere.I have, God woot, a large feeld to ere,And wayke been the oxen in my plough.The remenant of the tale is long ynough.I wol nat letten eek noon of this route;Lat every felawe telle his tale aboute,And lat se now who shal the soper wynne;And ther I lefte, I wol ayeyn bigynne.This duc, of whom I make mencioun,Whan he was come almoost unto the toun,In al his wele and in his mooste pride,He was war, as he caste his eye aside,Where that ther kneled in the heighe weyeA compaignye of ladyes, tweye and tweye,Ech after oother clad in clothes blake;But swich a cry and swich a wo they makeThat in this world

"Have ye so greet envyeOf myn honour, that thus compleyne and crye?Or who hath yow mysboden or offended?And telleth me if it may been amended,And why that ye been clothed thus in blak."The eldeste lady of them alle spak,Whan she hadde swowned with a deedly cheere,That it was routhe for to seen and heere;She seyde, "Lord, to whom Fortune hath yivenVictorie, and as a conqueror to lyven,Nat greveth us youre glorie and youre honour,But we biseken mercy and socour.Have mercy on oure wo and oure distresse!Som drope of pitee, thurgh thy gentillesse,Upon us wrecched wommen lat thou falle,For, certes, lord, ther is noon of us alleThat she ne hath been a duchesse or a queene.Now be we caytyves, as it is wel seene,Thanked be Fortune and hire false wheel,That noon estaat assureth to be weel.And certes, lord, to abyden youre presence,Heere in this temple of the goddesse ClemenceWe han ben waitynge al this fourtenyght.Now help us, lord, sith it is in thy myght."I, wrecche, which that wepe and wayle thus,Was whilom wyf to kyng Cappaneus,That starf at Thebes -- cursed be that day! --And alle we that been in this arrayAnd maken al this lamentacioun,We losten alle oure housbondes at that toun,Whil that the seege theraboute lay.And yet now the olde Creon -- weylaway! --That lord is now of Thebes the citee,Fulfild of ire and of iniquitee,He, for despit and for his tirannye,To do the dede bodyes vileynyeOf alle oure lordes whiche that been yslawe,Hath alle the bodyes on an heep ydrawe,And wol nat suffren hem, by noon assent,Neither to been yburyed nor ybrent,But maketh houndes ete them in despit."And with that word, withouten moore respit,They fillen gruf and criden pitously,"Have on us wrecched wommen som mercy,And lat oure sorwe synken in thyn herte."This gentil duc doun from his courser sterteWith herte pitous, whan he herde them speke.Hym thoughte that his herte wolde breke,Whan he saugh hem so pitous and so maat,That whilom weren of so greet estaat;And in his armes he hem alle up hente,And hem conforteth in ful good entente,And swoor his ooth, as he was trewe knyght,He wolde doon so ferforthly his myghtUpon the tiraunt Creon hem to wrekeThat al the peple of Grece sholde spekeHow Creon was of Theseus yservedAs he that hadde his deeth ful wel deserved.And right anoon, withouten moore abood,His baner he desplayeth, and forth roodTo Thebes-ward, and al his hoost biside.No neer Atthenes wolde he go ne ride,Ne take his ese fully half a day,But onward on his wey that nyght he lay,And sente anon Ypolita the queene,And Emelye, hir yonge suster sheene,Unto the toun of Atthenes to dwelle,And forth he rit; ther is namoore to telle.The rede statue of Mars, with spere and targe,So shyneth in his white baner largeThat alle the feeldes glyteren up and doun;And by his baner born is his penounOf gold ful riche, in which ther was ybeteThe Mynotaur, which that he wan in Crete.Thus rit this duc, thus rit this conquerour,And in his hoost of chivalrie the flour,Til that he cam to Thebes and alighteFaire in a feeld, ther as he thoughte to fighte.But shortly for to speken of this thyng,With Creon, which that was of Thebes kyng,He faught, and slough hym manly as a knyghtIn pleyn bataille, and putte the folk to flyght;And by assaut he wan the citee after,And rente adoun bothe wall and sparre and rafter;And to the ladyes he restored agaynThe bones of hir freendes that were slayn,To doon obsequies, as was tho the gyse.But it were al to longe for to devyseThe grete clamour and the waymentyngeThat the ladyes made at the brennyngeOf the bodies, and the grete honourThat Theseus, the noble conquerour,Dooth to the ladyes, whan they from hym wente;But shortly for to telle is myn entente.Whan that this worthy duc, this Theseus,Hath Creon slayn and wonne Thebes thus,Stille in that feeld he took al nyght his reste,And dide with al the contree as hym leste.To ransake in the taas of bodyes dede,Hem for to strepe of harneys and of wede,The pilours diden bisynesse and cureAfter the bataille and disconfiture.And so bifel that in the taas they founde,Thurgh-girt with many a grevous blody wounde,Two yonge knyghtes liggynge by and by,Bothe in oon armes, wroght ful richely,Of whiche two Arcita highte that oon,And that oother knyght highte Palamon.Nat fully quyke, ne fully dede they were,But by hir cote-armures and by hir gereThe heraudes knewe hem best in specialAs they that weren of the blood roialOf Thebes, and of sustren two yborn.Out of the taas the pilours han hem torn,And han hem caried softe unto the tenteOf Theseus; and he ful soone hem senteTo Atthenes, to dwellen in prisounPerpetuelly -- he nolde no raunsoun.And whan this worthy duc hath thus ydon,He took his hoost, and hoom he rit anonWith laurer crowned as a conquerour;And ther he lyveth in joye and in honourTerme of his lyf; what nedeth wordes mo?And in a tour, in angwissh and in wo,This Palamon and his felawe ArciteFor everemoore; ther may no gold hem quite.This passeth yeer by yeer and day by day,Till it fil ones, in a morwe of May,That Emelye, that fairer was to seneThan is the lylie upon his stalke grene,And fressher than the May with floures newe --For with the rose colour stroof hire hewe,I noot which was the fyner of hem two --Er it were day, as was hir wone to do,She was arisen and al redy dight,For May wole have no slogardie anyght.The sesoun priketh every gentil herte,And maketh it out of his slep to sterte,And seith "Arys, and do thyn observaunce."This maked Emelye have remembraunceTo doon honour to May, and for to ryse.Yclothed was she fressh, for to devyse:Hir yelow heer was broyded in a tresseBihynde hir bak, a yerde long, I gesse.And in the gardyn, at the sonne upriste,She walketh up and doun, and as hire listeShe gadereth floures, party white and rede,To make a subtil gerland for hire hede;And as an aungel hevenysshly she soong.The grete tour, that was so thikke and stroong,Which of the castel was the chief dongeoun(Ther as the knyghtes weren in prisounOf which I tolde yow and tellen shal),Was evene joynant to the gardyn walTher as this Emelye hadde hir pleyynge.Bright was the sonne and cleer that morwenynge,And Palamoun, this woful prisoner,As was his wone, by leve of his gayler,Was risen and romed in a chambre an heigh,In which he al the noble citee seigh,And eek the gardyn, ful of braunches grene,Ther as this fresshe Emelye the sheneWas in hire walk, and romed up and doun.This sorweful prisoner, this Palamoun,Goth in the chambre romynge to and froAnd to hymself compleynynge of his wo.That he was born, ful ofte he seyde, "allas!"And so bifel, by aventure or cas,That thurgh a wyndow, thikke of many a barreOf iren greet and square as any sparre,He cast his eye upon Emelya,And therwithal he bleynte and cride, "A!"As though he stongen were unto the herte.And with that cry Arcite anon up sterteAnd seyde, "Cosyn myn, what eyleth thee,That art so pale and deedly on to see?Why cridestow? Who hath thee doon offence?For Goddes love, taak al in pacienceOure prisoun, for it may noon oother be.Fortune hath yeven us this adversitee.Som wikke aspect or disposiciounOf Saturne, by som constellacioun,Hath yeven us this, although we hadde it sworn;So stood the hevene whan that we were born.We moste endure it; this is the short and playn."This Palamon answerde and seyde agayn,"Cosyn, for sothe, of this opiniounThow hast a veyn ymaginacioun.This prison caused me nat for to crye,But I was hurt right now thurghout myn yeInto myn herte, that wol my bane be.The fairnesse of that lady that I seeYond in the gardyn romen to and froIs cause of al my criyng and my wo.I noot wher she be womman or goddesse,But Venus is it soothly, as I gesse."And therwithal on knees doun he fil,And seyde, "Venus, if it be thy wilYow in this gardyn thus to transfigureBifore me, sorweful, wrecched creature,Out of this prisoun help that we may scapen.And if so be my destynee be shapenBy eterne word to dyen in prisoun,Of oure lynage have som compassioun,That is so lowe ybroght by tirannye."And with that word Arcite gan espyeWher as this lady romed to and fro,And with that sighte hir beautee hurte hym so,That, if that Palamon was wounded sore,Arcite is hurt as muche as he, or moore.And with a sigh he seyde pitously,"The fresshe beautee sleeth me sodeynlyOf hire that rometh in the yonder place;And but I have hir mercy and hir grace,That I may seen hire atte leeste weye,I nam but deed; ther nis namoore to seye."This Palamon, whan he tho wordes herde,Dispitously he looked and answerde,"Wheither seistow this in ernest or in pley?""Nay," quod Arcite, "in ernest, by my fey!God helpe me so, me list ful yvele pleye."This Palamon gan knytte his browes tweye."It nere," quod he, "to thee no greet honourFor to be fals, ne for to be traitourTo me, that am thy cosyn and thy brotherYsworn ful depe, and ech of us til oother,That nevere, for to dyen in the peyne,Til that the deeth departe shal us tweyne,Neither of us in love to hyndre oother,Ne in noon oother cas, my leeve brother,But that thou sholdest trewely forthren meIn every cas, as I shal forthren thee --This was thyn ooth, and myn also, certeyn;I woot right wel, thou darst it nat withseyn.Thus artow of my conseil, out of doute,And now thow woldest falsly been aboute To love my lady, whom I love and serve,And evere shal til that myn herte sterve.Nay, certes, false Arcite, thow shalt nat so.I loved hire first, and tolde thee my woAs to my conseil and my brother swornTo forthre me, as I have toold biforn.For which thou art ybounden as a knyghtTo helpen me, if it lay in thy myght,Or elles artow fals, I dar wel seyn."This Arcite ful proudly spak ageyn:"Thow shalt," quod he, "be rather fals than I;And thou art fals, I telle thee outrely,For paramour I loved hire first er thow.What wiltow seyen? Thou woost nat yet nowWheither she be a womman or goddesse!Thyn is affeccioun of hoolynesse,And myn is love as to a creature;For which I tolde thee myn aventureAs to my cosyn and my brother sworn.I pose that thow lovedest hire biforn;Wostow nat wel the olde clerkes sawe,That `who shal yeve a lovere any lawe?'Love is a gretter lawe, by my pan,Than may be yeve to any erthely man;And therfore positif lawe and swich decreeIs broken al day for love in ech degree.A man moot nedes love, maugree his heed;He may nat fleen it, thogh he sholde be deed,Al be she mayde, or wydwe, or elles wyf.And eek it is nat likly al thy lyfTo stonden in hir grace; namoore shal I;For wel thou woost thyselven, verraily,That thou and I be dampned to prisounPerpetuelly; us gayneth no raunsoun.We stryve as dide the houndes for the boon;They foughte al day, and yet hir part was noon.Ther cam a kyte, whil that they were so wrothe,And baar awey the boon bitwixe hem bothe.And therfore, at the kynges court, my brother,Ech man for hymself, ther is noon oother.Love, if thee list, for I love and ay shal;And soothly, leeve brother, this is al.Heere in this prisoun moote we endure,And everich of us take his aventure."Greet was the strif and long bitwix hem tweye,If that I hadde leyser for to seye;But to th'effect. It happed on a day,To telle it yow as shortly as I may,A worthy duc that highte Perotheus,That felawe was unto duc TheseusSyn thilke day that they were children lite,Was come to Atthenes his felawe to visite,And for to pleye as he was wont to do;For in this world he loved no man so,And he loved hym als tendrely agayn.So wel they lovede, as olde bookes sayn,That whan that oon was deed, soothly to telle,His felawe wente and soughte hym doun in helle --But of that storie list me nat to write.Duc Perotheus loved wel Arcite,And hadde hym knowe at Thebes yeer by yere,And finally at requeste and preyereOf Perotheus, withouten any raunsoun,Duc Theseus hym leet out of prisounFrely to goon wher that hym liste over al,In swich a gyse as I you tellen shal.This was the forward, pleynly for t'endite,Bitwixen Theseus and hym Arcite:That if so were that Arcite were yfoundeEvere in his lif, by day or nyght, oo stoundeIn any contree of this Theseus,And he were caught, it was acorded thus,That with a swerd he sholde lese his heed.Ther nas noon oother remedie ne reed;But taketh his leve, and homward he him spedde.Lat hym be war! His nekke lith to wedde.How greet a sorwe suffreth now Arcite!The deeth he feeleth thurgh his herte smyte;He wepeth, wayleth, crieth pitously;To sleen hymself he waiteth prively.He seyde, "Allas that day that I was born!Now is my prisoun worse than biforn;Now is me shape eternally to dwelleNoght in purgatorie, but in helle.Allas, that evere knew I Perotheus!For elles hadde I dwelled with Theseus,Yfetered in his prisoun everemo.Thanne hadde I been in blisse and nat in wo.Oonly the sighte of hire whom that I serve,Though that I nevere hir grace may deserve,Wolde han suffised right ynough for me.O deere cosyn Palamon," quod he,"Thyn is the victorie of this aventure.Ful blisfully in prison maistow dure --In prison? Certes nay, but in paradys!Wel hath Fortune yturned thee the dys,That hast the sighte of hire, and I th'absence.For possible is, syn thou hast hire presence,And art a knyght, a worthy and an able,That by som cas, syn Fortune is chaungeable,Thow maist to thy desir somtyme atteyne.But I, that am exiled and bareyneOf alle grace, and in so greet dispeirThat ther nys erthe, water, fir, ne eir,Ne creature that of hem maked is,That may me helpe or doon confort in this,Wel oughte I sterve in wanhope and distresse.Farwel my lif, my lust, and my gladnesse!"Allas, why pleynen folk so in communeOn purveiaunce of God, or of Fortune,That yeveth hem ful ofte in many a gyseWel bettre than they kan hemself devyse?Som man desireth for to han richesse,That cause is of his mordre or greet siknesse;And som man wolde out of his prisoun fayn,That in his hous is of his meynee slayn.Infinite harmes been in this mateere.We witen nat what thing we preyen heere;We faren as he that dronke is as a mous.A dronke man woot wel he hath an hous,But he noot which the righte wey is thider,And to a dronke man the wey is slider.And certes, in this world so faren we;We seken faste after felicitee,But we goon wrong ful often, trewely.Thus may we seyen alle, and namely I,That wende and hadde a greet opiniounThat if I myghte escapen from prisoun,Thanne hadde I been in joye and parfit heele,Ther now I am exiled fro my wele.Syn that I may nat seen you, Emelye,I nam but deed; ther nys no remedye."Upon that oother syde Palamon,Whan that he wiste Arcite was agon,Swich sorwe he maketh that the grete tourResouneth of his youlyng and clamour.The pure fettres on his shynes greteWeren of his bittre, salte teeres wete."Allas," quod he, "Arcita, cosyn myn,Of al oure strif, God woot, the fruyt is thyn.Thow walkest now in Thebes at thy large,And of my wo thow yevest litel charge.Thou mayst, syn thou hast wisdom and manhede,Assemblen alle the folk of oure kynrede,And make a werre so sharp on this citeeThat by som aventure or some treteeThow mayst have hire to lady and to wyfFor whom that I moste nedes lese my lyf.For, as by wey of possibilitee,Sith thou art at thy large, of prisoun free,And art a lord, greet is thyn avauntageMoore than is myn, that sterve here in a cage.For I moot wepe and wayle, whil I lyve,With al the wo that prison may me yive,And eek with peyne that love me yeveth also,That doubleth al my torment and my wo."Therwith the fyr of jalousie up sterteWithinne his brest, and hente him by the herteSo woodly that he lyk was to biholdeThe boxtree or the asshen dede and colde.Thanne seyde he, "O crueel goddes that governeThis world with byndyng of youre word eterne,And writen in the table of atthamauntYoure parlement and youre eterne graunt,What is mankynde moore unto you holdeThan is the sheep that rouketh in the folde?For slayn is man right as another beest,And dwelleth eek in prison and arreest,And hath siknesse and greet adversitee,And ofte tymes giltelees, pardee."What governance is in this prescience,That giltelees tormenteth innocence?And yet encresseth this al my penaunce,That man is bounden to his observaunce,For Goddes sake, to letten of his wille,Ther as a beest may al his lust fulfille.And whan a beest is deed he hath no peyne;But man after his deeth moot wepe and pleyne,Though in this world he have care and wo.Withouten doute it may stonden so.The answere of this lete I to dyvynys,But wel I woot that in this world greet pyne ys.Allas, I se a serpent or a theef,That many a trewe man hath doon mescheef,Goon at his large, and where hym list may turne.But I moot been in prisoun thurgh Saturne,And eek thurgh Juno, jalous and eek wood,That hath destroyed wel ny al the bloodOf Thebes with his waste walles wyde;And Venus sleeth me on that oother sydeFor jalousie and fere of hym Arcite."Now wol I stynte of Palamon a lite,And lete hym in his prisoun stille dwelle,And of Arcita forth I wol yow telle.The somer passeth, and the nyghtes longeEncressen double wise the peynes strongeBothe of the lovere and the prisoner.I noot which hath the wofuller mester.For, shortly for to seyn, this PalamounPerpetuelly is dampned to prisoun,In cheynes and in fettres to been deed;And Arcite is exiled upon his heedFor everemo, as out of that contree,Ne nevere mo ne shal his lady see.Yow loveres axe I now this questioun:Who hath the worse, Arcite or Palamoun?That oon may seen his lady day by day,But in prison he moot dwelle alway;That oother wher hym list may ride or go,But seen his lady shal he nevere mo.Now demeth as yow liste, ye that kan,For I wol telle forth as I bigan.Whan that Arcite to Thebes comen was,Ful ofte a day he swelte and seyde "Allas!"For seen his lady shal he nevere mo.And shortly to concluden al his wo,So muche sorwe hadde nevere creatureThat is, or shal, whil that the world may dure.His slep, his mete, his drynke, is hym biraft,That lene he wex and drye as is a shaft;His eyen holwe and grisly to biholde,His hewe falow and pale as asshen colde,And solitarie he was and evere allone,And waillynge al the nyght, makynge his mone;And if he herde song or instrument,Thanne wolde he wepe, he myghte nat be stent.So feble eek were his spiritz, and so lowe,And chaunged so, that no man koude knoweHis speche nor his voys, though men it herde.And in his geere for al the world he ferdeNat oonly lik the loveris maladyeOf Hereos, but rather lyk manye,Engendred of humour malencolikBiforen, in his celle fantastik.And shortly, turned was al up so dounBothe habit and eek disposiciounOf hym, this woful lovere daun Arcite.What sholde I al day of his wo endite?Whan he endured hadde a yeer or twoThis crueel torment and this peyne and wo,At Thebes, in his contree, as I seyde,Upon a nyght in sleep as he hym leyde,Hym thoughte how that the wynged god MercurieBiforn hym stood and bad hym to be murie.His slepy yerde in hond he bar uprighte;An hat he werede upon his heris brighte.Arrayed was this god, as he took keep,As he was whan that Argus took his sleep;And seyde hym thus: "To Atthenes shaltou wende,Ther is thee shapen of thy wo an ende."And with that word Arcite wook and sterte."Now trewely, hou soore that me smerte,"Quod he, "to Atthenes right now wol I fare,Ne for the drede of deeth shal I nat spareTo se my lady, that I love and serve.In hire presence I recche nat to sterve."And with that word he caughte a greet mirour,And saugh that chaunged was al his colour,And saugh his visage al in another kynde.And right anon it ran hym in his mynde,That, sith his face was so disfiguredOf maladye the which he hadde endured,He myghte wel, if that he bar hym lowe,Lyve in Atthenes everemoore unknowe,And seen his lady wel ny day by day.And right anon he chaunged his array,And cladde hym as a povre laborer,And al allone, save oonly a squierThat knew his privetee and al his cas,Which was disgised povrely as he was,To Atthenes is he goon the nexte way.And to the court he wente upon a day,And at the gate he profreth his servyseTo drugge and drawe, what so men wol devyse.And shortly of this matere for to seyn,He fil in office with a chamberleynThe which that dwellynge was with Emelye,For he was wys and koude soone espye,Of every servaunt, which that serveth here.Wel koude he hewen wode, and water bere,For he was yong and myghty for the nones,And therto he was long and big of bonesTo doon that any wight kan hym devyse.A yeer or two he was in this servyse,Page of the chambre of Emelye the brighte,And Philostrate he seyde that he highte.But half so wel biloved a man as heNe was ther nevere in court of his degree;He was so gentil of condiciounThat thurghout al the court was his renoun.They seyden that it were a chariteeThat Theseus wolde enhauncen his degree,And putten hym in worshipful servyse,Ther as he myghte his vertu excercise.And thus withinne a while his name is spronge,Bothe of his dedes and his goode tonge,That Theseus hath taken hym so neerThat of his chambre he made hym a squier,And gaf hym gold to mayntene his degree.And eek men broghte hym out of his contree,From yeer to yeer, ful pryvely his rente;But honestly and slyly he it spente,That no man wondred how that he it hadde.And thre yeer in this wise his lif he ladde,And bar hym so, in pees and eek in werre,Ther was no man that Theseus hath derre.And in this blisse lete I now Arcite,And speke I wole of Palamon a lite.In derknesse and horrible and strong prisounThise seven yeer hath seten PalamounForpyned, what for wo and for distresse.Who feeleth double soor and hevynesseBut Palamon, that love destreyneth soThat wood out of his wit he goth for wo?And eek therto he is a prisonerPerpetuelly, noght oonly for a yer.Who koude ryme in Englyssh proprelyHis martirdom? For sothe it am nat I;Therfore I passe as lightly as I may.It fel that in the seventhe yer, of MayThe thridde nyght (as olde bookes seyn,That al this storie tellen moore pleyn),Were it by aventure or destynee --As, whan a thyng is shapen, it shal be --That soone after the mydnyght Palamoun,By helpyng of a freend, brak his prisounAnd fleeth the citee faste as he may go.For he hadde yeve his gayler drynke soOf a clarree maad of a certeyn wyn,With nercotikes and opie of Thebes fyn,That al that nyght, thogh that men wolde him shake,The gayler sleep; he myghte nat awake.And thus he fleeth as faste as evere he may.The nyght was short and faste by the dayThat nedes cost he moot hymselven hyde,And til a grove faste ther bisydeWith dredeful foot thanne stalketh Palamon.For, shortly, this was his opinion:That in that grove he wolde hym hyde al day,And in the nyght thanne wolde he take his wayTo Thebes-ward, his freendes for to preyeOn Theseus to helpe him to werreye;And shortly, outher he wolde lese his lifOr wynnen Emelye unto his wyf.This is th'effect and his entente pleyn.Now wol I turne to Arcite ageyn,That litel wiste how ny that was his care,Til that Fortune had broght him in the snare.The bisy larke, messager of day,Salueth in hir song the morwe gray,And firy Phebus riseth up so brightThat al the orient laugheth of the light,And with his stremes dryeth in the grevesThe silver dropes hangynge on the leves.And Arcita, that in the court roialWith Theseus is principal squier,Is risen and looketh on the myrie day.And for to doon his observaunce to May,Remembrynge on the poynt of his desir,He on a courser, startlynge as the fir,Is riden into the feeldes hym to pleye,Out of the court, were it a myle or tweye.And to the grove of which that I yow toldeBy aventure his wey he gan to holdeTo maken hym a gerland of the greves,Were it of wodebynde or hawethorn leves,And loude he song ayeyn the sonne shene:"May, with alle thy floures and thy grene,Welcome be thou, faire, fresshe May,In hope that I som grene gete may."And from his courser, with a lusty herte,Into the grove ful hastily he sterte,And in a path he rometh up and doun,Ther as by aventure this PalamounWas in a bussh, that no man myghte hym se,For soore afered of his deeth was he.No thyng ne knew he that it was Arcite;God woot he wolde have trowed it ful lite.But sooth is seyd, go sithen many yeres,That "feeld hath eyen and the wode hath eres."It is ful fair a man to bere hym evene,For al day meeteth men at unset stevene.Ful litel woot Arcite of his felawe,That was so ny to herknen al his sawe,For in the bussh he sitteth now ful stille.Whan that Arcite hadde romed al his fille,And songen al the roundel lustily,Into a studie he fil sodeynly,As doon thise loveres in hir queynte geres,Now in the crope, now doun in the breres,Now up, now doun, as boket in a welle.Right as the Friday, soothly for to telle,Now it shyneth, now it reyneth faste,Right so kan geery Venus overcasteThe hertes of hir folk; right as hir dayIs gereful, right so chaungeth she array.Selde is the Friday al the wowke ylike.Whan that Arcite had songe, he gan to sikeAnd sette hym doun withouten any moore."Allas," quod he, "that day that I was bore!How longe, Juno, thurgh thy crueltee,Woltow werreyen Thebes the citee?Allas, ybroght is to confusiounThe blood roial of Cadme and Amphioun --Of Cadmus, which that was the firste manThat Thebes bulte, or first the toun bigan,And of the citee first was crouned kyng.Of his lynage am I and his ofspryngBy verray ligne, as of the stok roial,And now I am so caytyf and so thral,That he that is my mortal enemy,I serve hym as his squier povrely.And yet dooth Juno me wel moore shame,For I dar noght biknowe myn owene name;But ther as I was wont to highte Arcite,Now highte I Philostrate, noght worth a myte.Allas, thou felle Mars! Allas, Juno!Thus hath youre ire oure lynage al fordo,Save oonly me and wrecched Palamoun,That Theseus martireth in prisoun.And over al this, to sleen me outrelyLove hath his firy dart so brennynglyYstiked thurgh my trewe, careful herteThat shapen was my deeth erst than my sherte.Ye sleen me with youre eyen, Emelye!Ye been the cause wherfore that I dye.Of al the remenant of myn oother careNe sette I nat the montance of a tare,So that I koude doon aught to youre plesaunce."And with that word he fil doun in a traunceA longe tyme, and after he up sterte.This Palamoun, that thoughte that thurgh his herteHe felte a coold swerd sodeynliche glyde,For ire he quook; no lenger wolde he byde.And whan that he had herd Arcites tale,As he were wood, with face deed and pale,He stirte hym up out of the buskes thikkeAnd seide: "Arcite, false traytour wikke,Now artow hent, that lovest my lady so,For whom that I have al this peyne and wo,And art my blood, and to my conseil sworn,As I ful ofte have told thee heerbiforn,And hast byjaped heere duc Theseus,And falsly chaunged hast thy name thus!I wol be deed, or elles thou shalt dye.Thou shalt nat love my lady Emelye,But I wol love hire oonly and namo;For I am Palamon, thy mortal foo.And though that I no wepene have in this place,But out of prison am astert by grace,I drede noght that outher thow shalt dye,Or thow ne shalt nat loven Emelye.Chees which thou wolt, or thou shalt nat asterte!"This Arcite, with ful despitous herte,Whan he hym knew, and hadde his tale herd,As fiers as leon pulled out his swerd,And seyde thus: "By God that sit above,Nere it that thou art sik and wood for love,And eek that thow no wepne hast in this place,Thou sholdest nevere out of this grove pace,That thou ne sholdest dyen of myn hond.For I defye the seurete and the bondWhich that thou seist that I have maad to thee.What! Verray fool, thynk wel that love is free,And I wol love hire maugree al thy myght!But for as muche thou art a worthy knyghtAnd wilnest to darreyne hire by bataille,Have heer my trouthe; tomorwe I wol nat faille,Withoute wityng of any oother wight,That heere I wol be founden as a knyght,And bryngen harneys right ynough for thee;And ches the beste, and leef the worste for me.And mete and drynke this nyght wol I bryngeYnough for thee, and clothes for thy beddynge.And if so be that thou my lady wynne,And sle me in this wode ther I am inne,Thow mayst wel have thy lady as for me."This Palamon answerde, "I graunte it thee."And thus they been departed til amorwe, Whan ech of hem had leyd his feith to borwe.O Cupide, out of alle charitee!O regne, that wolt no felawe have with thee!Ful sooth is seyd that love ne lordshipeWol noght, his thankes, have no felaweshipe.Wel fynden that Arcite and Palamoun.Arcite is riden anon unto the toun,And on the morwe, er it were dayes light,Ful prively two harneys hath he dight,Bothe suffisaunt and mete to darreyneThe bataille in the feeld bitwix hem tweyne;And on his hors, allone as he was born,He carieth al the harneys hym biforn.And in the grove, at tyme and place yset,This Arcite and this Palamon ben met.To chaungen gan the colour in hir face;Right as the hunters in the regne of Trace,That stondeth at the gappe with a spere,Whan hunted is the leon or the bere,And hereth hym come russhyng in the greves,And breketh bothe bowes and the leves,And thynketh, "Heere cometh my mortal enemy!Withoute faille, he moot be deed, or I,For outher I moot sleen hym at the gappe,Or he moot sleen me, if that me myshappe."So ferden they in chaungyng of hir hewe,As fer as everich of hem oother knewe.Ther nas no good day, ne no saluyng,But streight, withouten word or rehersyng,Everich of hem heelp for to armen ootherAs freendly as he were his owene brother;And after that, with sharpe speres strongeThey foynen ech at oother wonder longe.Thou myghtest wene that this PalamonIn his fightyng were a wood leon,And as a crueel tigre was Arcite;As wilde bores gonne they to smyte,That frothen whit as foom for ire wood.Up to the ancle foghte they in hir blood.And in this wise I lete hem fightyng dwelle,And forth I wole of Theseus yow telle.The destinee, ministre general,That executeth in the world over alThe purveiaunce that God hath seyn biforn,So strong it is that, though the world had swornThe contrarie of a thyng by ye or nay,Yet somtyme it shal fallen on a dayThat falleth nat eft withinne a thousand yeer.For certeinly, oure appetites heer,Be it of werre, or pees, or hate, or love,Al is this reuled by the sighte above.This mene I now by myghty Theseus,That for to hunten is so desirus,And namely at the grete hert in May,That in his bed ther daweth hym no dayThat he nys clad, and redy for to rydeWith hunte and horn and houndes hym bisyde.For in his huntyng hath he swich delitThat it is al his joye and appetitTo been hymself the grete hertes bane,For after Mars he serveth now Dyane.Cleer was the day, as I have toold er this,And Theseus with alle joye and blis,With his Ypolita, the faire queene,And Emelye, clothed al in grene,On huntyng be they riden roially.And to the grove that stood ful faste by,In which ther was an hert, as men hym tolde,Duc Theseus the streighte wey hath holde.And to the launde he rideth hym ful right,For thider was the hert wont have his flight,And over a brook, and so forth on his weye.This duc wol han a cours at hym or tweyeWith houndes swiche as that hym list comaunde.And whan this duc was come unto the launde,Under the sonne he looketh, and anonHe was war of Arcite and Palamon,That foughten breme as it were bores two.The brighte swerdes wenten to and froSo hidously that with the leeste strookIt semed as it wolde felle an ook.But what they were, no thyng he ne woot.This duc his courser with his spores smoot,And at a stert he was bitwix hem two,And pulled out a swerd and cride, "Hoo!Namoore, up peyne of lesynge of youre heed!By myghty Mars, he shal anon be deedThat smyteth any strook that I may seen.But telleth me what myster men ye been,That been so hardy for to fighten heereWithouten juge or oother officere,As it were in a lystes roially."This Palamon answerde hastilyAnd seyde, "Sire, what nedeth wordes mo?We have the deeth disserved bothe two.Two woful wrecches been we, two caytyves,That been encombred of oure owene lyves;And as thou art a rightful lord and juge,Ne yif us neither mercy ne refuge,But sle me first, for seinte charitee!But sle my felawe eek as wel as me;Or sle hym first, for though thow knowest it lite,This is thy mortal foo, this is Arcite,That fro thy lond is banysshed on his heed,For which he hath deserved to be deed.For this is he that cam unto thy gateAnd seyde that he highte Philostrate.Thus hath he japed thee ful many a yer,And thou hast maked hym thy chief squier;And this is he that loveth Emelye.For sith the day is come that I shal dye,I make pleynly my confessiounThat I am thilke woful PalamounThat hath thy prisoun broken wikkedly.I am thy mortal foo, and it am IThat loveth so hoote Emelye the brighteThat I wol dye present in hir sighte.Wherfore I axe deeth and my juwise;But sle my felawe in the same wise,For bothe han we deserved to be slayn."This worthy duc answerde anon agayn,And seyde, "This is a short conclusioun.Youre owene mouth, by youre confessioun,Hath dampned yow, and I wol it recorde;It nedeth noght to pyne yow with the corde.Ye shal be deed, by myghty Mars the rede!"The queene anon, for verray wommanhede,Gan for to wepe, and so dide Emelye,And alle the ladyes in the compaignye.Greet pitee was it, as it thoughte hem alle,That evere swich a chaunce sholde falle,For gentil men they were of greet estaat,And no thyng but for love was this debaat;And saugh hir blody woundes wyde and soore,And alle crieden, bothe lasse and moore,"Have mercy, Lord, upon us wommen alle!"And on hir bare knees adoun they falleAnd wolde have kist his feet ther as he stood;Til at the laste aslaked was his mood,For pitee renneth soone in gentil herte.And though he first for ire quook and sterte,He hath considered shortly, in a clause,The trespas of hem bothe, and eek the cause,And although that his ire hir gilt accused,Yet in his resoun he hem bothe excused,As thus: he thoghte wel that every manWol helpe hymself in love, if that he kan,And eek delivere hymself out of prisoun.And eek his herte hadde compassiounOf wommen, for they wepen evere in oon,And in his gentil herte he thoughte anon,And softe unto hymself he seyde, "FyUpon a lord that wol have no mercy,But been a leon, bothe in word and dede,To hem that been in repentaunce and drede,As wel as to a proud despitous manThat wol mayntene that he first bigan.That lord hath litel of discrecioun,That in swich cas kan no divisiounBut weyeth pride and humblesse after oon."And shortly, whan his ire is thus agoon,He gan to looken up with eyen lighteAnd spak thise same wordes al on highte:"The god of love, a benedicite!How myghty and how greet a lord is he!Ayeyns his myght ther gayneth none obstacles.He may be cleped a god for his myracles,For he kan maken, at his owene gyse,Of everich herte as that hym list divyse.Lo heere this Arcite and this Palamoun,That quitly weren out of my prisoun,And myghte han lyved in Thebes roially,And witen I am hir mortal enemy,And that hir deth lith in my myght also,And yet hath love, maugree hir eyen two,Broght hem hyder bothe for to dye.Now looketh, is nat that an heigh folye?Who may been a fool but if he love?Bihoold, for Goddes sake that sit above,Se how they blede! Be they noght wel arrayed?Thus hath hir lord, the god of love, ypayedHir wages and hir fees for hir servyse!And yet they wenen for to been ful wyseThat serven love, for aught that may bifalle.But this is yet the beste game of alle,That she for whom they han this joliteeKan hem therfore as muche thank as me.She woot namoore of al this hoote fare,By God, than woot a cokkow or an hare!But all moot ben assayed, hoot and coold;A man moot ben a fool, or yong or oold --I woot it by myself ful yore agon,For in my tyme a servant was I oon.And therfore, syn I knowe of loves peyneAnd woot hou soore it kan a man distreyne,As he that hath ben caught ofte in his laas,I yow foryeve al hoolly this trespaas,At requeste of the queene, that kneleth heere,And eek of Emelye, my suster deere.And ye shul bothe anon unto me swereThat nevere mo ye shal my contree dere,Ne make werre upon me nyght ne day,But been my freendes in all that ye may.I yow foryeve this trespas every deel."And they hym sworen his axyng faire and weel,And hym of lordshipe and of mercy preyde,And he hem graunteth grace, and thus he seyde:"To speke of roial lynage and richesse,Though that she were a queene or a princesse,Ech of you bothe is worthy, doutelees,To wedden whan tyme is;

What dooth this queene of love,But wepeth so, for wantynge of hir wille,Til that hir teeres in the lystes fille?She seyde, "I am ashamed, doutelees."Saturnus seyde, "Doghter, hoold thy pees!Mars hath his wille, his knyght hath al his boone,And, by myn heed, thow shalt been esed soone."The trompours, with the loude mynstralcie,The heraudes, that ful loude yelle and crie,Been in hire wele for joye of daun Arcite.But herkneth me, and stynteth noyse a lite,Which a myracle ther bifel anon.This fierse Arcite hath of his helm ydon,And on a courser, for to shewe his face,He priketh endelong the large placeLokynge upward upon this Emelye;And she agayn hym caste a freendlich ye(For wommen, as to speken in comune,Thei folwen alle the favour of Fortune)And was al his chiere, as in his herte.Out of the ground a furie infernal sterte,From Pluto sent at requeste of Saturne,For which his hors for fere gan to turne,And leep aside, and foundred as he leep;And er that Arcite may taken keep,He pighte hym on the pomel of his heed,That in the place he lay as he were deed,His brest tobrosten with his sadel-bowe.As blak he lay as any cole or crowe,So was the blood yronnen in his face.Anon he was yborn out of the place,With herte soor, to Theseus paleys.Tho was he korven out of his harneysAnd in a bed ybrought ful faire and blyve,For he was yet in memorie and alyve,And alwey criynge after Emelye.Duc Theseus, with al his compaignye,Is comen hoom to Atthenes his citee,With alle blisse and greet solempnitee.Al be it that this aventure was falle,He nolde noght disconforten hem alle.Men seyde eek that Arcite shal nat dye;He shal been heeled of his maladye.And of another thyng they weren as fayn,That of hem alle was ther noon yslayn,Al were they soore yhurt, and namely oon,That with a spere was thirled his brest boon.To othere woundes and to broken armesSomme hadden salves, and somme hadden charmes;Fermacies of herbes, and eek saveThey dronken, for they wolde hir lymes have.For which this noble duc, as he wel kan,Conforteth and honoureth every man,And made revel al the longe nyghtUnto the straunge lordes, as was right.Ne ther was holden no disconfityngeBut as a justes or a tourneiynge;For soothly ther was no disconfiture.For fallyng nys nat but an aventure,Ne to be lad by force unto the stakeUnyolden, and with twenty knyghtes take,O persone allone, withouten mo,And haryed forth by arme, foot, and too,And eke his steede dryven forth with stavesWith footmen, bothe yemen and eek knaves --It nas arretted hym no vileynye;Ther may no man clepen it cowardye.For which anon duc Theseus leet crye,To stynten alle rancour and envye,The gree as wel of o syde as of oother,And eyther syde ylik as ootheres brother;And yaf hem yiftes after hir degree,And fully heeld a feeste dayes three,And conveyed the kynges worthilyOut of his toun a journee largely.And hoom wente every man the righte way.Ther was namoore but "Fare wel, have good day!"Of this bataille I wol namoore endite,But speke of Palamon and of Arcite.Swelleth the brest of Arcite, and the sooreEncreesseth at his herte moore and moore.The clothered blood, for any lechecraft,Corrupteth, and is in his bouk ylaft,That neither veyne-blood, ne ventusynge,Ne drynke of herbes may ben his helpynge.The vertu expulsif, or animal,Fro thilke vertu cleped naturalNe may the venym voyden ne expelle.The pipes of his longes gonne to swelle,And every lacerte in his brest adounIs shent with venym and corrupcioun.Hym gayneth neither, for to gete his lif,Vomyt upward, ne dounward laxatif.Al is tobrosten thilke regioun;Nature hath now no dominacioun.And certeinly, ther Nature wol nat wirche,Fare wel phisik! Go ber the man to chirche!This al and som, that Arcita moot dye;For which he sendeth after Emelye,And Palamon, that was his cosyn deere.Thanne seyde he thus, as ye shal after heere:"Naught may the woful spirit in myn herteDeclare o point of alle my sorwes smerteTo yow, my lady, that I love moost,But I biquethe the servyce of my goostTo yow aboven every creature,Syn that my lyf may no lenger dure.Allas, the wo! Allas, the peynes stronge,That I for yow have suffred, and so longe!Allas, the deeth! Allas, myn Emelye!Allas, departynge of oure compaignye!Allas, myn hertes queene! Allas, my wyf,Myn hertes lady, endere of my lyf!What is this world? What asketh men to have?Now with his love, now in his colde graveAllone, withouten any compaignye.Fare wel, my sweete foo, myn Emelye!And softe taak me in youre armes tweye,For love of God, and herkneth what I seye."I have heer with my cosyn PalamonHad strif and rancour many a day agonFor love of yow, and for my jalousye.And Juppiter so wys my soule gye,To speken of a servaunt proprely,With alle circumstances trewely --That is to seyen, trouthe, honour, knyghthede,Wysdom, humblesse, estaat, and heigh kynrede,Fredom, and al that longeth to that art --So Juppiter have of my soule part,As in this world right now ne knowe I nonSo worthy to ben loved as Palamon,That serveth yow, and wol doon al his lyf.And if that evere ye shul ben a wyf,Foryet nat Palamon, the gentil man."And with that word his speche faille gan,For from his feet up to his brest was comeThe coold of deeth, that hadde hym overcome,And yet mooreover, for in his armes twoThe vital strengthe is lost and al ago.Oonly the intellect, withouten moore,That dwelled in his herte syk and soore,Gan faillen whan the herte felte deeth.Dusked his eyen two, and failled breeth,But on his lady yet caste he his ye;His laste word was, "Mercy, Emelye!"His spirit chaunged hous and wente ther,As I cam nevere, I kan nat tellen wher.Therfore I stynte; I nam no divinistre;Of soules fynde I nat in this registre,Ne me ne list thilke opinions to telleOf hem, though that they writen wher they dwelle.Arcite is coold, ther Mars his soule gye!Now wol I speken forth of Emelye.Shrighte Emelye, and howleth Palamon,And Theseus his suster took anonSwownynge, and baar hire fro the corps away.What helpeth it to tarien forth the dayTo tellen how she weep bothe eve and morwe?For in swich cas wommen have swich sorwe,Whan that hir housbondes ben from hem ago,That for the moore part they sorwen so,Or ellis fallen in swich maladyeThat at the laste certeinly they dye.Infinite been the sorwes and the teeresOf olde folk and folk of tendre yeeresIn al the toun for deeth of this Theban.For hym ther wepeth bothe child and man;So greet wepyng was ther noon, certayn,Whan Ector was ybroght, al fressh yslayn,To Troye. Allas, the pitee that was ther,Cracchynge of chekes, rentynge eek of heer."Why woldestow be deed," thise wommen crye,"And haddest gold ynough, and Emelye?"No man myghte gladen Theseus,Savynge his olde fader Egeus,That knew this worldes transmutacioun,As he hadde seyn it chaunge bothe up and doun,Joye after wo, and wo after gladnesse,And shewed hem ensamples and liknesse."Right as ther dyed nevere man," quod he,"That he ne lyvede in erthe in some degree,Right so ther lyvede never man," he seyde,"In al this world, that som tyme he ne deyde.This world nys but a thurghfare ful of wo,And we been pilgrymes, passynge to and fro.Deeth is an ende of every worldly soore."And over al this yet seyde he muchel mooreTo this effect, ful wisely to enhorteThe peple that they sholde hem reconforte.Duc Theseus, with al his bisy cure,Caste now wher that the sepultureOf goode Arcite may best ymaked be,And eek moost honurable in his degree.And at the laste he took conclusiounThat ther as first Arcite and PalamounHadden for love the bataille hem bitwene,That in that selve grove, swoote and grene,Ther as he hadde his amorouse desires,His compleynte, and for love his hoote fires,He wolde make a fyr in which the officeFuneral he myghte al accomplice.And leet comande anon to hakke and heweThe okes olde, and leye hem on a reweIn colpons wel arrayed for to brenne.His officers with swifte feet they renneAnd ryde anon at his comandement.And after this, Theseus hath ysentAfter a beere, and it al overspraddeWith clooth of gold, the richeste that he hadde.And of the same suyte he cladde Arcite;Upon his hondes hadde he gloves white,Eek on his heed a coroune of laurer grene,And in his hond a swerd ful bright and kene.He leyde hym, bare the visage, on the beere;Therwith he weep that pitee was to heere.And for the peple sholde seen hym alle,Whan it was day, he broghte hym to the halle,That roreth of the criyng and the soun.Tho cam this woful Theban Palamoun,With flotery berd and ruggy, asshy heeres,In clothes blake, ydropped al with teeres;And, passynge othere of wepynge, Emelye,The rewefulleste of al the compaignye.In as muche as the servyce sholde beThe moore noble and riche in his degree,Duc Theseus leet forth thre steedes brynge,That trapped were in steel al gliterynge,And covered with the armes of daun Arcite.Upon thise steedes, that weren grete and white,Ther seten folk, of whiche oon baar his sheeld,Another his spere up on his hondes heeld,The thridde baar with hym his bowe Turkeys(Of brend gold was the caas and eek the harneys);And riden forth a paas with sorweful cheereToward the grove, as ye shul after heere.The nobleste of the Grekes that ther wereUpon hir shuldres caryeden the beere,With slakke paas and eyen rede and wete,Thurghout the citee by the maister strete,That sprad was al with blak, and wonder hyeRight of the same is the strete ywrye.Upon the right hond wente olde Egeus,And on that oother syde duc Theseus,With vessels in hir hand of gold ful fyn,Al ful of hony, milk, and blood, and wyn;Eek Palamon, with ful greet compaignye;And after that cam woful Emelye,With fyr in honde, as was that tyme the gyse,To do the ritual of funeral service.Heigh labour and ful greet apparaillyngeWas at the service and the fyr-makynge,That with his grene top the hevene raughte;And twenty fadme of brede the armes straughte --This is to seyn, the bowes weren so brode.Of stree first ther was leyd ful many a lode.But how the fyr was maked upon highte,Ne eek the names that the trees highte,As ook, firre, birch, aspe, alder, holm, popler,Wylugh, elm, plane, assh, box, chasteyn, lynde, laurer,Mapul, thorn, bech, hasel, ew, whippeltree --How they weren feld shal nat be toold for me;Ne hou the goddes ronnen up and doun,Disherited of hire habitacioun,In which they woneden in reste and pees,Nymphes, fawnes and amadrides;Ne hou the beestes and the briddes alleFledden for fere, whan the wode was falle;Ne how the ground agast was of the light,That was nat wont to seen the sonne bright;Ne how the fyr was couched first with stree,And thanne with drye stikkes cloven a thre,And thanne with grene wode and spicerye,And thanne with clooth of gold and with perrye,And gerlandes, hangynge with ful many a flour;The mirre, th'encens, with al so greet odour;Ne how Arcite lay among al this,Ne what richesse aboute his body is;Ne how that Emelye, as was the gyse,Putte in the fyr of funeral servyse;Ne how she swowned whan men made the fyr,Ne what she spak, ne what was hir desir;Ne what jeweles men in the fyre caste,Whan that the fyr was greet and brente faste;Ne how somme caste hir sheeld, and somme hir spere,And of hire vestimentz, whiche that they were,And coppes fulle of wyn, and milk, and blood,Into the fyr, that brente as it were wood;Ne how the Grekes, with an huge route,Thries riden al the fyr abouteUpon the left hand, with a loud shoutynge,And thries with hir speres claterynge;And thries how the ladyes gonne crye;And how that lad was homward Emelye;Ne how Arcite is brent to asshen colde;Ne how that lyche-wake was yholdeAl thilke nyght; ne how the Grekes pleyeThe wake-pleyes; ne kepe I nat to seyeWho wrastleth best naked with oille enoynt,Ne who that baar hym best, in no disjoynt.I wol nat tellen eek how that they goonHoom til Atthenes, whan the pley is doon;But shortly to the point thanne wol I wendeAnd maken of my longe tale an ende.By processe and by lengthe of certeyn yeres,Al stynted is the moornynge and the teresOf Grekes, by oon general assent.Thanne semed me ther was a parlementAt Atthenes, upon certein pointz and caas;Among the whiche pointz yspoken was,To have with certein contrees alliaunce,And have fully of Thebans obeisaunce.For which this noble Theseus anonLeet senden after gentil Palamon,Unwist of hym what was the cause and why,But in his blake clothes sorwefullyHe cam at his comandement in hye.Tho sente Theseus for Emelye.Whan they were set, and hust was al the place,And Theseus abiden hadde a spaceEr any word cam fram his wise brest,His eyen sette he ther as was his lest.And with a sad visage he siked stille,And after that right thus he seyde his wille:"The Firste Moevere of the cause above,Whan he first made the faire cheyne of love,Greet was th'effect, and heigh was his entente.Wel wiste he why, and what thereof he mente,For with that faire cheyne of love he bondThe fyr, the eyr, the water, and the londIn certeyn boundes, that they may nat flee.That same Prince and that Moevere," quod he,"Hath stablissed in this wrecched world adounCerteyne dayes and duraciounTo al that is engendred in this place,Over the whiche day they may nat pace,Al mowe they yet tho dayes wel abregge.Ther nedeth noght noon auctoritee t'allegge,For it is preeved by experience,But that me list declaren my sentence.Thanne may men by this ordre wel discerneThat thilke Moevere stable is and eterne.Wel may men knowe, but it be a fool,That every part dirryveth from his hool,For nature hath nat taken his bigynnyngOf no partie or cantel of a thyng,But of a thyng that parfit is and stable,Descendynge so til it be corrumpable.And therfore, of his wise purveiaunce,He hath so wel biset his ordinaunceThat speces of thynges and progressiounsShullen enduren by successiouns,And nat eterne, withouten any lye.This maystow understonde and seen at ye."Loo the ook, that hath so long a norisshyngeFrom tyme that it first bigynneth to sprynge,And hath so long a lif, as we may see,Yet at the laste wasted is the tree."Considereth eek how that the harde stoonUnder oure feet, on which we trede and goon,Yet wasteth it as it lyth by the weye.The brode ryver somtyme wexeth dreye;The grete tounes se we wane and wende.Thanne may ye se that al this thyng hath ende."Of man and womman seen we wel alsoThat nedes, in oon of thise termes two --This is to seyn, in youthe or elles age --He moot be deed, the kyng as shal a page;Som in his bed, som in the depe see,Som in the large feeld, as men may see;Ther helpeth noght; al goth that ilke weye.Thanne may I seyn that al this thyng moot deye."What maketh this but Juppiter, the kyng,That is prince and cause of alle thyng,Convertynge al unto his propre welleFrom which it is dirryved, sooth to telle?And heer-agayns no creature on lyve,Of no degree, availleth for to stryve."Thanne is it wysdom, as it thynketh me,To maken vertu of necessitee,And take it weel that we may nat eschue,And namely that to us alle is due.And whoso gruccheth ought, he dooth folye,And rebel is to hym that al may gye.And certeinly a man hath moost honourTo dyen in his excellence and flour,Whan he is siker of his goode name;Thanne hath he doon his freend, ne hym, no shame.And gladder oghte his freend been of his deeth,Whan with honour up yolden is his breeth,Than whan his name apalled is for age,For al forgeten is his vassellage.Thanne is it best, as for a worthy fame,To dyen whan that he is best of name."The contrarie of al this is wilfulnesse.Why grucchen we, why have we hevynesse,That goode Arcite, of chivalrie flour,Departed is with duetee and honourOut of this foule prisoun of this lyf?Why grucchen heere his cosyn and his wyfOf his welfare, that loved hem so weel?Kan he hem thank? Nay, God woot, never a deel,That both his soule and eek hemself offende,And yet they mowe hir lustes nat amende."What may I conclude of this longe serye,But after wo I rede us to be meryeAnd thanken Juppiter of al his grace?And er that we departen from this placeI rede that we make of sorwes twoO parfit joye, lastynge everemo.And looketh now, wher moost sorwe is herinne,Ther wol we first amenden and bigynne."Suster," quod he, "this is my fulle assent,With al th'avys heere of my parlement,That gentil Palamon, youre owene knyght,That serveth yow with wille, herte, and myght,And ever hath doon syn ye first hym knewe,That ye shul of youre grace upon hym rewe,And taken hym for housbonde and for lord.Lene me youre hond, for this is oure accord.Lat se now of youre wommanly pitee.He is a kynges brother sone, pardee;And though he were a povre bacheler,Syn he hath served yow so many a yeer,And had for yow so greet adversitee,It moste been considered, leeveth me,For gentil mercy oghte to passen right."Thanne seyde he thus to Palamon the knight:"I trowe ther nedeth litel sermonyngTo make yow assente to this thyng.Com neer, and taak youre lady by the hond."Bitwixen hem was maad anon the bondThat highte matrimoigne or mariage,By al the conseil and the baronage.And thus with alle blisse and melodyeHath Palamon ywedded Emelye.And God, that al this wyde world hath wroght,Sende hym his love that hath it deere aboght;For now is Palamon in alle wele,Lyvynge in blisse, in richesse, and in heele,And Emelye hym loveth so tendrely,And he hire serveth so gentilly,That nevere was ther no word hem bitweneOf jalousie or any oother teene.Thus endeth Palamon and Emelye;And God save al this faire compaignye! Amen.
