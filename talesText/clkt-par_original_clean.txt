 Ther is, at the west syde of Ytaille,
 Doun at the roote of Vesulus the colde,
 A lusty playn, habundant of vitaille,
 Where many a tour and toun thou mayst biholde,
 That founded were in tyme of fadres olde,
 And many another delitable sighte,
 And Saluces this noble contree highte.
 A markys whilom lord was of that lond,
 As were his worthy eldres hym bifore;
 And obeisant, ay redy to his hond,
 Were alle his liges, bothe lasse and moore.
 Thus in delit he lyveth, and hath doon yoore,
 Biloved and drad, thurgh favour of Fortune,
 Bothe of his lordes and of his commune.
 Therwith he was, to speke as of lynage,
 The gentilleste yborn of Lumbardye,
 A fair persone, and strong, and yong of age,
 And ful of honour and of curteisye;
 Discreet ynogh his contree for to gye,
 Save in somme thynges that he was to blame;
 And Walter was this yonge lordes name.
 I blame hym thus: that he considered noght
 In tyme comynge what myghte hym bityde,
 But on his lust present was al his thoght,
 As for to hauke and hunte on every syde.
 Wel ny alle othere cures leet he slyde,
 And eek he nolde -- and that was worst of alle --
 Wedde no wyf, for noght that may bifalle.
 Oonly that point his peple bar so soore
 That flokmeele on a day they to hym wente,
 And oon of hem, that wisest was of loore --
 Or elles that the lord best wolde assente
 That he sholde telle hym what his peple mente,
 Or elles koude he shewe wel swich mateere --
 He to the markys seyde as ye shul heere:
 "O noble markys, youre humanitee
 Asseureth us and yeveth us hardinesse,
 As ofte as tyme is of necessitee,
 That we to yow mowe telle oure hevynesse.
 Accepteth, lord, now of youre gentillesse
 That we with pitous herte unto yow pleyne,
 And lat youre eres nat my voys desdeyne.
 "Al have I noght to doone in this mateere
 Moore than another man hath in this place,
 Yet for as muche as ye, my lord so deere,
 Han alwey shewed me favour and grace
 I dar the bettre aske of yow a space
 Of audience to shewen oure requeste,
 And ye, my lord, to doon right as yow leste.
 "For certes, lord, so wel us liketh yow
 And al youre werk, and evere han doon, that we
 Ne koude nat us self devysen how
 We myghte lyven in moore felicitee,
 Save o thyng, lord, if it youre wille be,
 That for to been a wedded man yow leste;
 Thanne were youre peple in sovereyn hertes reste.
 "Boweth youre nekke under that blisful yok
 Of soveraynetee, noght of servyse,
 Which that men clepe spousaille or wedlok;
 And thenketh, lord, among youre thoghtes wyse
 How that oure dayes passe in sondry wyse,
 For thogh we slepe, or wake, or rome, or ryde,
 Ay fleeth the tyme; it nyl no man abyde.
 "And thogh youre grene youthe floure as yit,
 In crepeth age alwey, as stille as stoon,
 And deeth manaceth every age, and smyt
 In ech estaat, for ther escapeth noon;
 And al so certein as we knowe echoon
 That we shul deye, as uncerteyn we alle
 Been of that day whan deeth shal on us falle.
 "Accepteth thanne of us the trewe entente,
 That nevere yet refuseden youre heeste,
 And we wol, lord, if that ye wole assente,
 Chese yow a wyf, in short tyme atte leeste,
 Born of the gentilleste and of the meeste
 Of al this land, so that it oghte seme
 Honour to God and yow, as we kan deeme.
 "Delivere us out of al this bisy drede,
 And taak a wyf, for hye Goddes sake!
 For if it so bifelle, as God forbede,
 That thurgh youre deeth youre lyne sholde slake,
 And that a straunge successour sholde take
 Youre heritage, O wo were us alyve!
 Wherfore we pray you hastily to wyve."
 Hir meeke preyere and hir pitous cheere
 Made the markys herte han pitee.
 "Ye wol," quod he, "myn owene peple deere,
 To that I nevere erst thoughte streyne me.
 I me rejoysed of my liberte,
 That seelde tyme is founde in mariage;
 Ther I was free, I moot been in servage.
 "But nathelees I se youre trewe entente,
 And truste upon youre wit, and have doon ay;
 Wherfore of my free wyl I wole assente
 To wedde me, as soone as evere I may.
 But ther as ye han profred me to-day
 To chese me a wyf, I yow relesse
 That choys and prey yow of that profre cesse.
 "For God it woot, that children ofte been
 Unlyk hir worthy eldres hem bifore;
 Bountee comth al of God, nat of the streen
 Of which they been engendred and ybore.
 I truste in Goddes bountee, and therfore
 My mariage and myn estaat and reste
 I hym bitake; he may doon as hym leste.
 "Lat me allone in chesynge of my wyf --
 That charge upon my bak I wole endure.
 But I yow preye, and charge upon youre lyf,
 What wyf that I take, ye me assure
 To worshipe hire, whil that hir lyf may dure,
 In word and werk, bothe heere and everywheere,
 As she an emperoures doghter weere.
 "And forthermoore, this shal ye swere: that ye
 Agayn my choys shul neither grucche ne stryve;
 For sith I shal forgoon my libertee
 At youre requeste, as evere moot I thryve,
 Ther as myn herte is set, ther wol I wyve;
 And but ye wole assente in swich manere,
 I prey yow, speketh namoore of this matere."
 With hertely wyl they sworen and assenten
 To al this thyng -- ther seyde no wight nay --
 Bisekynge hym of grace, er that they wenten,
 That he wolde graunten hem a certein day
 Of his spousaille, as soone as evere he may;
 For yet alwey the peple somwhat dredde,
 Lest that the markys no wyf wolde wedde.
 He graunted hem a day, swich as hym leste,
 On which he wolde be wedded sikerly,
 And seyde he dide al this at hir requeste.
 And they, with humble entente, buxomly,
 Knelynge upon hir knees ful reverently,
 Hym thonken alle; and thus they han an ende
 Of hire entente, and hoom agayn they wende.
 And heerupon he to his officeres
 Comaundeth for the feste to purveye,
 And to his privee knyghtes and squieres
 Swich charge yaf as hym liste on hem leye;
 And they to his comandement obeye,
 And ech of hem dooth al his diligence
 To doon unto the feeste reverence.
 Noght fer fro thilke paleys honurable,
 Wher as this markys shoop his mariage,
 There stood a throop, of site delitable,
 In which that povre folk of that village
 Hadden hir beestes and hir herbergage,
 And of hire labour tooke hir sustenance,
 After that the erthe yaf hem habundance.
 Amonges thise povre folk ther dwelte a man
 Which that was holden povrest of hem alle;
 But hye God somtyme senden kan
 His grace into a litel oxes stalle;
 Janicula men of that throop hym calle.
 A doghter hadde he, fair ynogh to sighte,
 And Grisildis this yonge mayden highte.
 But for to speke of vertuous beautee,
 Thanne was she oon the faireste under sonne;
 For povreliche yfostred up was she,
 No likerous lust was thurgh hire herte yronne.
 Wel ofter of the welle than of the tonne
 She drank, and for she wolde vertu plese,
 She knew wel labour but noon ydel ese.
 But thogh this mayde tendre were of age,
 Yet in the brest of hire virginitee
 Ther was enclosed rype and sad corage;
 And in greet reverence and charitee
 Hir olde povre fader fostred shee.
 A fewe sheep, spynnynge, on feeld she kepte;
 She wolde noght been ydel til she slepte.
 And whan she homward cam, she wolde brynge
 Wortes or othere herbes tymes ofte,
 The whiche she shredde and seeth for hir lyvynge,
 And made hir bed ful hard and nothyng softe;
 And ay she kepte hir fadres lyf on-lofte
 With everich obeisaunce and diligence
 That child may doon to fadres reverence.
 Upon Grisilde, this povre creature,
 Ful ofte sithe this markys sette his ye
 As he on huntyng rood paraventure;
 And whan it fil that he myghte hire espye,
 He noght with wantown lookyng of folye
 His eyen caste on hire, but in sad wyse
 Upon hir chiere he wolde hym ofte avyse,
 Commendynge in his herte hir wommanhede,
 And eek hir vertu, passynge any wight
 Of so yong age, as wel in chiere as dede.
 For thogh the peple have no greet insight
 In vertu, he considered ful right
 Hir bountee, and disposed that he wolde
 Wedde hire oonly, if evere he wedde sholde.
 The day of weddyng cam, but no wight kan
 Telle what womman that it sholde be;
 For which merveille wondred many a man,
 And seyden, whan they were in privetee,
 "Wol nat oure lord yet leve his vanytee?
 Wol he nat wedde? Allas! Allas, the while!
 Why wole he thus hymself and us bigile?"
 But nathelees this markys hath doon make
 Of gemmes, set in gold and in asure,
 Brooches and rynges, for Grisildis sake;
 And of hir clothyng took he the mesure
 By a mayde lyk to hire stature,
 And eek of othere aornementes alle
 That unto swich a weddyng sholde falle.
 The time of undren of the same day
 Approcheth, that this weddyng sholde be,
 And al the paleys put was in array,
 Bothe halle and chambres, ech in his degree;
 Houses of office stuffed with plentee
 Ther maystow seen, of deyntevous vitaille
 That may be founde as fer as last Ytaille.
 This roial markys, richely arrayed,
 Lordes and ladyes in his compaignye,
 The whiche that to the feeste weren yprayed,
 And of his retenue the bachelrye,
 With many a soun of sondry melodye,
 Unto the village of the which I tolde
 In this array the righte wey han holde.
 Grisilde of this, God woot, ful innocent,
 That for hire shapen was al this array,
 To fecchen water at a welle is went,
 And cometh hoom as soone as ever she may;
 For wel she hadde herd seyd that thilke day
 The markys sholde wedde, and if she myghte,
 She wolde fayn han seyn som of that sighte.
 She thoghte, "I wole with othere maydens stonde,
 That been my felawes, in oure dore and se
 The markysesse, and therfore wol I fonde
 To doon at hoom, as soone as it may be,
 The labour which that longeth unto me,
 And thanne I may at leyser hire biholde,
 If she this wey unto the castel holde."
 And as she wolde over hir threshold gon,
 The markys cam and gan hire for to calle;
 And she set doun hir water pot anon,
 Biside the thresshfold, in an oxes stalle,
 And doun upon hir knes she gan to falle,
 And with sad contenance kneleth stille,
 Til she had herd what was the lordes wille.
 This thoghtful markys spak unto this mayde
 Ful sobrely, and seyde in this manere:
 "Where is youre fader, O Grisildis?" he sayde.
 And she with reverence, in humble cheere,
 Answerde, "Lord, he is al redy heere."
 And in she gooth withouten lenger lette,
 And to the markys she hir fader fette.
 He by the hand thanne took this olde man,
 And seyde thus, whan he hym hadde asyde:
 "Janicula, I neither may ne kan
 Lenger the plesance of myn herte hyde.
 If that thou vouche sauf, what so bityde,
 Thy doghter wol I take, er that I wende,
 As for my wyf, unto hir lyves ende.
 "Thou lovest me, I woot it wel certeyn,
