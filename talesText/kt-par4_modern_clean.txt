&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Great was the feast in Athens that day,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And also the pleasing season of that May<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Made every person to be in such delight<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That all that Monday they joust and dance,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And spend that day in Venus's noble service.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But because they must rise<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Early, to see the great fight,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Unto their rest they went at nightfall.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And in the morning, when day did spring,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Noise and clattering of horses and armor <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There was in hostelries all about,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And to the palace there rode many a company<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Of lords upon steeds and palfreys.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There canst thou see preparation of armor<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So exotic and so rich, and wrought so well<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Of goldsmiths' works, of embroidery, and of steel;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The bright shields, horses' head-armor, and horse-armor,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Gold-colored helms, coats of mail, tunics with heraldic devices; <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Lords in richly decorated robes on their coursers,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Knights of  (their) retinues, and also squires<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nailing heads to the spear-shafts, and buckling helms;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Fitting the shields with straps, fastening with laces --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Where it is needed they were not at all idle;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The steeds frothing on the golden bridles<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Gnawing, and fast the armorers also<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With file and hammer are spurring to and fro;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Yeomen on foot, and foot soldiers many a one<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With short staves, thick as they can go;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Pipes, trumpets, kettle drums, bugles,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That blow bloody sounds in the battle;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The palace full of people everywhere,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Here three, there ten, debating, <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Conjecturing about these two Theban knights.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Some said thus, some said "it shall be so";<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Some held with him with the black beard,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Some with the bald, some with the thickly haired;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Some said he looked grim, and he would fight:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"He has a battle-ax of twenty pounds of weight."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Thus was the hall full of conjecturing,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Long after the sun began to rise.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The great Theseus, who was awakened of his sleep<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;By the music and noise that was made,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Remained yet in the chamber of his rich palace <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Until the Theban knights, both equally<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Honored, were fetched into the palace.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Duke Theseus was set at a window,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Arrayed exactly as if he were a god on a throne.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The people press thither full soon<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In order to see him, and to do great reverence,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And also to hear his command and his decision.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A herald on a scaffold made a "Ho!"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Until all the noise of people was done,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And when he saw the people all still of noise,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Then showed he the mighty duke's will:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"The lord has of his great sound judgment<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Considered that it would be destruction<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To gentle blood to fight in the manner<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Of mortal battle now in this undertaking.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Wherefore, to arrange matters so that they shall not die,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He will modify his previous plan.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;No man therefore, upon punishment of loss of life,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;No sort of arrow, nor battle-axe, nor short knife<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Send into the lists or bring there;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nor short sword, to stab with piercing point,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;May no man neither draw, nor bear it by his side.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And no man shall ride at his opponent<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;More than one course with a sharply honed spear; <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Let him thrust, if he wishes, on foot, to defend himself.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And he who is at a disadvantage shall be taken<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And not slain, but be brought unto the stake<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That shall be placed on either side;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But thither he must (go) by force, and remain there.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And if so happen that the chieftain be taken<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;On either side, or else should slay his opponent,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The tournament shall last no longer.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;God give you success! Go forth and lay on fast!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With long sword and with mace fight your fill.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Go now on your way; this is the lord's will."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The voice of people touched the heaven,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So loudly they cried with merry voices,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"God save such a lord, that is so good<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He desires no destruction of blood!"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Up go the trumpets and the melody,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And to the lists rides the company,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In battle array, throughout all the city, <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Hung with cloth of gold, and not with serge.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Fully like a lord this noble duke did ride,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;These two Thebans upon either side,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And after rode the queen and Emelye,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And after that another company<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;One after another, according to their rank.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And thus they pass throughout the city,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And they come to the lists in good time.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It was not yet fully prime (nine a.m.) of the day <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When Theseus was set very splendidly and nobly,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ypolita the queen, and Emelye,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And other ladies about in tiers.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Unto the seats press all the crowd.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And westward, through the gates under Mars,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Arcite, and also the hundred of his party,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With red banner is entered right away;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And in that same moment Palamon<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Is under Venus, eastward in the place,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With white banner and hardy countenance and face.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In all the world, to seek up and down,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So evenly, without variation,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There were not two such companies,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For there was no one so wise that could say<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That any one had advantage over the other <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In worthiness, nor in status, nor age,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So evenly were they chosen, as I estimate.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And in two fair ranks they arrange themselves.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When every one of their names were read,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So that in their total number there would be no deception,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Then the gates were shut, and cried was aloud:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Do now your duty, proud young knights!"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The heralds left their spurring up and down;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Now trumpets and bugles ring loud. <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There is no more to say, but from west and east<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In go the spears very firmly in the lance-rests;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In goes the sharp spur into the flank.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There people see who can joust and who can ride;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There splinter spears upon thick shields;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He feels the stabbing through the breast-bone.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Up spring spears twenty foot on height;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Out go the swords bright as silver;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The helms they hew to pieces and cut into shreds<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Out burst the blood in strong red streams;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With mighty maces they break the bones to pieces.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He did thrust through the thickest of the throng;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There strong steeds stumble, and down goes all,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He rolls under foot as does a ball;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;On his feet he stabs with the broken shaft of his spear,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And he hurtles him down with his horse;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He is hurt through the body and then taken,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Despite all he can do, and brought unto the stake;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As was the agreement, right there he must abide.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Another on that other side is led away.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And for a while Theseus makes them rest,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To refresh themselves and drink, if they wish.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Many times these two Thebans have  <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Met together, and (each) wrought woe to his opponent;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Each has unhorsed the other of them two.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There was not any tiger in the vale of Gargaphia, <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When her whelp is stolen when it is little,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So cruel on the hunt as is Arcite<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For jealous heart upon this Palamon.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nor in Benmarin there is not so fierce a lion,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That is hunted, or maddened by his hunger,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nor of his prey desires so the blood,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As Palamon to slay his foe Arcite.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The fervent strokes bite on their helms;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Out runs red blood on both their sides.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Some time there is an end of every deed.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For before the sun went unto its rest,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The strong king Emetreus did seize<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This Palamon, as he fought with Arcite,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And made his sword deep in his flesh to bite,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And by the force of twenty he (Palamon) is taken  <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Without having surrendered, and dragged to the stake.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And in the rescue of this Palamon<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The strong king Lygurge is born down,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And king Emetreus, despite all his strength,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Is carried out of his saddle a sword's length,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So hit him Palamon before he was taken.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But all for naught; he was brought to the stake.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;His hardy heart could not help him:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He must abide, when he was caught,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;By force and also by the agreed terms of battle.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Who sorrows now but woeful Palamon,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That must no more go again to fight?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And when Theseus had seen this sight,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Unto each one of the folk that fought thus <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He cried, "Stop! no more, for it is done!  <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I will be true judge, and no partisan.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Arcite of Thebes shall have Emelye,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Who by his fortune has won her fairly."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Immediately there is a noise of people begun<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For joy of this, so loud and clamorous indeed<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It seemed that the lists should fall.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;What now can fair Venus do above?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;What says she now? What does this queen of love,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But weeps so, for lack of (having) her will,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Until her tears fell in the lists? <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She said, "I am disgraced, doubtless."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Saturn said, "Daughter, hold thy peace!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mars has his will, his knight has all his request,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And, by my head, thou shalt be relieved soon."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The trumpeters, with the loud music,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The heralds, who full loudly yell and cry,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Are in their happiest state for joy of dan Arcite.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But listen to me, and stop the noise for a little,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(Hear) what a miracle at once befell there.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This fierce Arcite has taken off his helm,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And on a war horse, to show his face,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He spurs from one end to the other of the large open space<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Looking upward upon this Emelye;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And she to him cast a friendly eye<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(For women, so to speak in general,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;They all follow the favor of Fortune)<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And was all his source of pleasure, in his heart.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Out of the ground leaped an infernal fury,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Sent from Pluto at the request of Saturn,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For which his horse for fear began to turn,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And leaped aside, and stumbled as he leaped;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And before Arcite can take heed,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He hit himself on the top of his head,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That in the place he lay as if he were dead,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;His breast shattered by his saddlebow.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He lay as black as any coal or crow,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The blood was so run in his face.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Immediately he was carried out of the place,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With painful heart, to Theseus's palace.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Then was he cut out of his armor<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And brought in a bed very gently and quickly,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For he was yet conscious and alive,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And always crying for Emelye.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Duke Theseus, with all his company,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Is come home to Athens, his city,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With all bliss and great solemnity.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Although this accident had happened,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He would not distress them all.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;People said also that Arcite shall not dye;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He shall be healed of his injuries.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And of another thing they were as happy,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That of them all there was no one slain,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Although they (were) sorely hurt, and especially one,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Whose breastbone was pierced by a spear.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To other wounds and to broken arms<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Some had salves, and some had charms;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Medicines made of herbs, and also of sage<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;They drank, for they wanted to have their limbs cured.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For which this noble duke, as he well knows how,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Comforts and honors every man,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And made revel all the long night<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For the foreign lords, as was right.  <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nor was it considered any defeat (in battle)<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But (only) as a joust or a tournament;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For truly there was no defeat.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For falling is nothing but an accident,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nor to be led by force unto the stake<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Without having surrendered, and taken by twenty knights,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;One person alone, without others,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And dragged forth by arm, foot, and toe,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And also his steed driven forth with staves<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;By men on foot, both yeomen and also foot soldiers --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He incurred no shameful blame for it; <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; No man there may call it cowardice.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For which anon duke Theseus had proclaimed,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To put a stop to all rancor and ill-will,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The victory (is given) as well to one side as to the other,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And either side equal as the other's brother; <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And gave them gifts in accordance with their ranks,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And held a feast for fully three days,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And honorably escorted the kings <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Out of his town a full day's journey.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And home went every man the direct way.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There was no more but "Fare well, have good day!"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Of this battle I will write no more,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But speak of Palamon and of Arcite.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The breast of Arcite swells, and the pain<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;At his heart increases more and more.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The clotted blood, despite any medical treatment,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Corrupts, and is left in the trunk of his body,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That neither blood letting at a vein, nor applying suction cups,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nor drink of herbs can be any help to him.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The power expulsive (to expel fluids), or animal,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;From that power called natural<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Can not remove nor expel the poison.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The pipes of his lungs began to swell,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And every muscle down in his breast<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Is destroyed by poison and corrupted matter.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Avails him neither, to preserve his life,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Vomit upward, nor downward laxative.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;All is shattered in that region;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nature now has no power to control. <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And certainly, where Nature will not work,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Fare well medicine! Go bear the man to church!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This is the whole of it, that Arcite must die;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For which he sends after Emelye,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And Palamon, who was his dear cousin.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Then said he thus, as you shall after hear:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"The woeful spirit in my heart can not<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Declare one small part of all my painful sorrows<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To you, my lady, whom I love most,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But I bequeath the service of my ghost<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To you above every creature,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Since my life can no longer endure.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Alas, the woe! Alas, the strong pains,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That I have suffered for you, and so long!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Alas, the death! Alas, my Emelye!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Alas, separation of our company!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Alas, my heart's queen! Alas, my wife,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;My heart's lady, ender of my life!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;What is this world? What do people ask to have?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Now with his love, now in his cold grave<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Alone, without any company.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Fare well, my sweet foe, my Emelye!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And softly take me in your two arms,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For love of God, and listen to what I say.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I have here with my cousin Palamon<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Had strife and rancor many a day ago<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For love of you, and for my jealousy.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And as Jupiter may guide my soul,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To speak specifically of a servant (of love),<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With all the attendant attributes truly --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That is to say, truth, honor, knighthood,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Wisdom, humbleness, rank, and noble ancestry,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nobility of character, and all that belongs to that art --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As Jupiter may have concern for my soul,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In this world right now I know no one<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So worthy to be loved as Palamon,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Who serves you, and will do so all his life.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And if ever you shall be a wife,   <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Forget not Palamon, the gentle man."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And with that word his speech began to fail,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For from his feet up to his breast had come<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The cold of death, which had overcome him,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And yet moreover, for in his two arms <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The vital strength is lost and all gone.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Only the intellect, nothing else,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That dwelled in his heart sick and sore,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Began to fail when the heart felt death.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;His two eyes grew dark, and his breath failed,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But on his lady yet he cast his eye;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;His last word was, "Mercy, Emelye!"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;His spirit changed house and went where,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Since I came never (there), I can not tell where.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Therefore I stop; I am no theologian;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I find nothing about souls in this register,  <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nor do I wish to tell such beliefs  <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Of them, though they write of where they (the souls) dwell.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Arcite is cold, may Mars guide his soul!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Now will I speak forth of Emelye.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Emelye shrieked, and Palamon howls,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And Theseus immediately took his sister <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Swooning, and carried her away from the corpse.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;What helps it to waste the whole day<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To tell how she wept both evening and morning?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For in such cases women have such sorrow,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When their husbands are gone from them,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That for the most part they so sorrow,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Or else fall in such illness<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That at the last certainly they die.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Infinite are the sorrows and the tears<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Of old folk and folk of tender years<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In all the town for the death of this Theban.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For him there weep both child and man;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There was no such great weeping, certainly,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When Hector was brought, just recently slain,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To Troy. Alas, the lamentation that was there,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Scratching of cheeks, also tearing of hair.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Why wouldst thou be dead," these women cry,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Since thou haddest gold enough, and Emelye?"<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;No man might comfort Theseus,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Except for his old father Egeus,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Who knew the changes of this world,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As he had seen it change both up and down,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Joy after woe, and woe after gladness,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And showed them examples and comparisons.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Right as there died never a man," said he,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Who did not live in earth to some extent<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Just so there lived never a man," he said,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"In all this world, who some time did not die.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This world is nothing but a thoroughfare full of woe,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And we are pilgrims, passing to and fro.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Death is an end of every worldly pain."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And beyond all this yet he said much more<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To this effect, full wisely to exhort<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The people that they should comfort themselves. <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Duke Theseus, with all his careful attention,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Considered now where the tomb<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Of good Arcite may best be made,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And also most honorable in (regard to) his rank.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And at the last he concluded<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That there where first Arcite and Palamon<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Had the battle between them for love,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That in that same grove, sweet-smelling and green, <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Where he had his amorous desires,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;His lament, and for love his hot fires,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He would make a fire in which the rite<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Of a funeral he might fully perform.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And he ordered immediately to hack and hew<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The old oaks, and lay them in a row<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In piles arranged to burn well.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;His officers with swift feet they run<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And ride quickly at his commandment.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And after this, Theseus has sent<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For a bier, and it all overspread<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With cloth of gold, the richest that he had.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And of the same material he clad Arcite;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Upon his hands he had white gloves,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Also on his head a crown of green laurel,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And in his hand a sword full bright and keen.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He laid him, with the face bare, on the bier;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Therewith he wept that it was a pity to hear.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And in order that all the people should see him,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When it was day, he brought him to the hall,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That resounds with the crying and the sound.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Then came this woeful Theban Palamon,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With waving beard and rough hair sprinkled with ashes,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In black clothes, all sprinkled with tears;  <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And, excelling others in weeping, Emelye,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The most pitiful of all the company.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In order that the ritual should be<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The more noble and rich in its degree,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Duke Theseus had three steeds brought forth,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That were equipped with trappings of steel all glittering,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And covered with the coat of arms of Don Arcite.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Upon these steeds, that were large and white,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There sat folk, of which one carried his (Arcite's) shield,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Another held his spear upright in his hands,  <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The third carried with him his Turkish bow<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(Of pure gold was the quiver and also the fittings);<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And they rode forth slowly with sorrowful demeanor<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Toward the grove, as you shall later hear.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The noblest of the Greeks that were there <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Carried the bier upon their shoulders,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With slow pace and eyes red and wet,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Throughout the city by the main street,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Which was all spread with black, and wonderfully high<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The street is covered with exactly the same.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Upon the right hand went old Egeus,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And on that other side duke Theseus,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With vessels of pure gold in their hands,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;All full of honey, milk, and blood, and wine;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Also Palamon, with a very large company;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And after that came woeful Emelye,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With fire in hand, as was at that time the custom,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To do the office of funeral service.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Much labor and full great preparation <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Was at the service and the fire-making,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Which with its green top reached the heaven;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And twenty fathom of breadth the sides stretched --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This is to say, the boughs were so broad.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There was first laid very many a load of straw.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But how the fire was made on high,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nor also the names that the trees are called,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Such as oak, fir, birch, aspen, alder, holm oak, poplar,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Willow, elm, plane, ash, box, chestnut, linden, laurel,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Maple, thorn, beech, hazel, yew, dogwood --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;How they were cut down shall not be told by me;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nor how the gods ran up and down,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Disinherited of their habitation,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In which they dwelt in rest and peace,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nymphs, fawns and hamadryades (wood nymphs);<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nor how the beasts and the birds all<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Fled for fear, when the wood was cut down;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nor how frightened by the light was the ground,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Which was not accustomed to see the bright sun;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nor how the fire was laid first with straw,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And then with dry branches cut in thirds,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And then with green wood and mixtures of spices,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And then with cloth of gold and with precious stones<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And garlands, hanging with full many a flower;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The myrrh, the incense, with such great fragrance;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nor how Arcite lay among all this,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nor what richness about his body is;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nor how Emelye, as was the custom,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Lighted the fire of funeral service;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nor how she swooned when men made the fire,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nor what she spoke, nor what was her desire;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nor what jewels men threw in the fire,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When the fire was great and burned fast;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nor how some threw their shields, and some their spears,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And of their vestments, which they wore,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And cups full of wine, and milk, and blood,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Into the fire, that burned as if it were mad;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nor how the Greeks, with a huge company,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Thrice ride all the fire about<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Upon the left hand, with a loud shouting,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And thrice with their spears clattering;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And thrice how the ladies did cry;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And how Emelye was led homeward;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nor how Arcite is burned to cold ashes;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nor how that wake was held  <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;All that same night; nor how the Greeks play<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The funeral games I care not to say<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Who wrestles best, naked with oil anointed,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nor who bore him best, in any difficulty.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I will not tell also how they go<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Home to Athens, when the games are done;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But shortly to the point then I will go<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And make an end of my long tale.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;By the course of events and by length of a certain number of years,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;All stopped is the mourning and the tears<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Of the Greeks, by one general assent.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Then it seemed to me there was a parliament<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;At Athens, upon certain topics and cases;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Among which topics was discussed (a proposal)<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To have alliance with certain countries,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And have fully the submission of the Thebans.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For which this noble Theseus immediately<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ordered (someone) to send for gentle Palamon,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Unknown by him (Palamon) what was the cause and why,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But in his black clothes sorrowfully<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He came at his (Theseus's) commandment in haste.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Then Theseus sent for Emelye.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When they were set, and all the place was hushed,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And Theseus had waited for a while<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Before any word came from his wise breast,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He set his eyes where his object of desire was.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And with a sad face he sighed softly,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And after that exactly thus he pronounced his decision:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"The First Mover of the First Cause above,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When he first made the faire chain of love,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Great was the effect, and noble was his plan.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Well knew he why, and what thereof he meant,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For with that faire chain of love he bound<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The fire, the air, the water, and the land<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In definite bounds, from which they may not flee.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That same Prince and that Mover," said he,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Has established in this wretched world below<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Specific (numbers of) days and  (term of) duration<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To all that is engendered in this place,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Beyond the which day they can not pass,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Although they may yet well shorten those days.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There is no need to cite any written authority,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For it is proven by experience,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Unless I wish to make my meaning more clear.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Then one can by this order well discern<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That that same Mover is stable and eternal.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Well may one know, unless it be a fool,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That every part derives from its whole,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For nature has not taken its beginning<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Of no part or portion of a thing,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But of a thing that is complete and stable,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Descending (from that) until it becomes corruptible.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And therefore, by his wise foresight,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He has so well established his plan<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That types of being and natural processes<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Shall endure (for a set time) one after another,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And not eternally, without any lie.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This thou canst understand and plainly see.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Lo the oak, that is so slow to mature,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;From the time that it first begins to spring,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And has so long a life, as we may see,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Yet at the last the tree is wasted away.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Consider also how the hard stone<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Under our feet, on which we tread and go,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Eventually it is worn away as it lies by the way.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The broad river sometimes grows dry;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We see the great cities grow weak and pass away.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Then you can see that all things have an end.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Of man and woman also we see well <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That by necessity, in one of these two periods of time --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This is to say, in youth or else in age --<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He must be dead, the king as must a servant boy;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;One in his bed, one in the deep sea,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;One in the large field, as people can see;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nothing helps there; all goes that same way.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Then may I say that all things must die.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"What causes this but Jupiter, the king,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Who is prince and cause of all things,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Causing all to return to its own origin<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;From which it is derived, to tell the truth?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And against this no living creature,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Of any rank, is helped by striving.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Then is it wisdom, as it seems to me,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To make virtue of necessity,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And take it well what we may not escape,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And namely that which is due to us all.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And whoever complains in any way, he does folly,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And is rebel to Him that can rule all.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And certainly a man has most honor<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To die in his (time of) excellence and flower,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When he is sure of his good name;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Then he has not done his friend, nor himself, any shame.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And his friend ought to be more pleased with his death,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When his breath is yielded up with honor,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Than when his name is faded because of age,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For all forgotten is his knightly prowess.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Then is it best, for a worthy fame,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To die when he has the most fame.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"The contrary of all this is willfulness.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Why do we complain, why do we have sadness,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That good Arcite, flower of chivalry,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Is departed with all due honor<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Out of this foul prison of this life?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Why do his cousin and his wife complain here<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Of the welfare of him, who loved them so well?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Can he show them his gratitude? Nay, God knows, not a bit;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;They offend both his soul and themselves as well,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And as yet they may not change their desires.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"What  can I conclude of this long argument,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But after woe I advise us to be merry<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And thank Jupiter for all his grace?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And before we depart from this place<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I advise that we make of two sorrows <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;One perfect joy, lasting evermore.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And look now, where most sorrow is herein,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There will we first amend and begin.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Sister," said he, "this is my full intention,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With all the advice of my parliament here,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That gentle Palamon, your own knight,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Who serves you with will, heart, and might,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And ever has done so since you first knew him,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That you shall of your grace have pity upon him,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And take him for husband and for lord.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Lend me your hand, for this is our decision.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Let your womanly pity now be seen.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He is a king's brother's son, indeed;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And even if he were a poor young knight,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Since he has served you so many a year,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And has had for you such great adversity,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It must be taken in account, believe me,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For gentle mercy ought to prevail over justice."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Then said he thus to Palamon the knight:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I suppose little preaching is needed here<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To make you assent to this thing.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Come near, and take your lady by the hand."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Between them was made right away the bond<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That is called matrimony or marriage,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;By all the council and the baronage.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And thus with all bliss and festivity<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Palamon has wedded Emelye.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And God, who has made all this wide world,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Send him his love who has dearly paid for it;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For now is Palamon in complete happiness,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Living in bliss, in riches, and in health,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And Emelye loves him so tenderly,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And he serves her so gently,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That never was there any word between them <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Of jealousy or any other vexation.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Thus ends Palamon and Emelye;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And God save all this fair company! Amen.<BR>
