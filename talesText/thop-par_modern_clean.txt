When all this miracle was told, every man
Was so sober that it was wonderful to see,
Until our Host then began to joke 
And then for the first time he looked at me,
And said thus: "What sort of man art thou?" said he;
"Thou lookest as if thou would track a hare,
For ever upon the ground I see thee stare.
" Approach nearer, and look up merrily.
Now make way, sirs, and let this man have room!
He in the waist is shaped as well as I;
This would be a little doll in an arm to embrace
For any woman, small and fair of face.
He seems otherworldly in his behavior,
For unto no person is he sociable:
"Say something now, since other folk have spoken;
Tell us a tale of mirth, and that right now."
"Host," said I, "be not displeased,
For certainly I know no other tale,
Except for a riming romance I learned long ago."
"Yes, that is good," said he; "now we shall hear
Some dainty thing, it seems to me from his appearance."
Listen, my lords, with good will,
And I will tell truly 
Of mirth and of pleasure,
All about a knight who was fair and gentle
In battle and in tournament; 
His name was sir Thopas.
He was born in a distant land,
In Flanders, far beyond the sea,
At Popering, in that place.
His father was a very noble man,
And he was lord of that country,
Since it was God's will.
Sir Thopas grew up to be a doughty lad; 
White was his face as fine white bread,
His lips red as a rose; 
His complexion is like scarlet deeply dyed,
And I tell you in true certainty
He had a seemly nose.
His hair, his beard was like saffron,
That to his girdle reached down; 
His shoes of Cordovan leather.
Of Bruges were his brown stockings,
His robe was of silk woven with gold,
That cost many a half-penny.
He knew how to hunt for wild animals,
And ride a-hawking for water-fowl
With grey gos-hawk on hand; 
Moreover he was a good archer; 
In wrestling there was no one his peer,
Where any ram shall stand (as a prize).
Very many a maid, bright in bed-chamber,
They mourn for him passionately,
When it would be better for them to sleep; 
But he was chaste and no lecher,
And sweet as is the dog rose
That bears the red hip.
And it so happened upon a day,
In truth, as I can tell you,
Sir Thopas wanted to ride out.
He mounted upon his gray steed,
And in his hand a light lance,
A long sword by his side.
He spurs through a fair forest,
In which is many a wild best,
Yea, both buck and hare; 
And as he spurs north and east,
I tell it you, to him had almost
Happened a grievous misfortune.
There spring herbs large and small,
The licorice and the zedoary,
And many a clove-gillyflower;  
And nutmeg to put in ale,
Whether it be new or old,
Or to lay in a clothes press.
The birds sing, it can not be denied,
The sparrow hawk and the parrot,
That it was joy to hear; 
The male thrush made also her lay,
The wood-pigeon upon the branch
She sang very loud and clear.
Sir Thopas fell in a yearning for love,
As soon as he heard the thrush sing,
And spurred as if he were crazy.
His fair steed in his spurring
So sweated that one could wring him; 
His sides were all blood.
Sir Thopas also so weary was
For spurring on the soft grass,
So fierce was his heart,
That down he laid him in that place
To give his steed some rest,
And gave him good dry fodder.
"O Saint Mary, bless me!
What does this love have against me
To bind me so painfully?
I dreamed all this night, by God,
An elf-queen shall be my sweetheart
And sleep under my cloak.
"An elf-queen will I love, indeed,
For in this world no woman is
Worthy to be my mate
In town; 
All other women I forsake,
And to an elf-queen I betake nyself,
By dale and also by hill!"
Into his saddle he climbed at once,
And spurs over stile and stone
An elf-queen for to see,
Until he so long had ridden and walked
That he found, in a secret place,
The country of Fairy
So wild; 
For in that country there was no one
Who dared ride or go on foot at him,
Neither woman nor child; 
Until there came a big giant,
His name was sir Olifaunt,
A perilous man of deeds.
He said, "Child, by Termagaunt,
Unless thou spur out of my territory,
At once I will slay thy steed
With mace.
Here is the queen of Fairyland,
With harp and pipe and hurdy-gurdy,
Dwelling in this place."
The child said, "As I may prosper,
Tomorrow will I meet with thee,
When I have my armor; 
And yet I trust, by my faith,
That thou shalt by means of this light lance  
Very bitterly pay for it.
Thy maw
Shall I pierce, if I can,
Ere it be fully prime of day (9 a.m.),
For here thou shalt be slain."
Sir Thopas drew back very fast; 
This giant threw stones at him 
Out of a terrible staff-sling.
But child Thopas safely escapes,
And it was all due to God's grace,
And due to his fair bearing.
Yet listen, gentlemen, to my tale
Merrier than the nightingale,
For now I will you tell
How sir Thopas, with slender waist,
Spurring over hill and dale,
Is come again to town.
His merry men commanded he
To make him both amusement and delight,
For by necessity he must fight
With a giant with three heads,
For love and pleasure
Of one who shone very bright.
"Do come," he said, "my musicians,
And story tellers to tell tales,
Right now in my arming,
Of romances that are royal,
Of popes and of cardinals,
And also of the joys of love."
They fetched him first the sweet wine,
And mead also in a maple drinking bowl,
And royal delicacies
Of gingerbread that was very fine,
And licorice, and also cumin,
With sugar that is excellent.
He put on next to his white flesh
Of linen cloth fine and clear,
A pair of trousers and also a shirt; 
And next to his shirt a quilted jacket,
And over that a chain-mail shirt 
To prevent piercing of his heart; 
And over that a fine plate armor,
Which was all wrought with jewelers' work,
Very strong it was of iron plate; 
And over that his surcoat
As white as is a lily flour,
In which he will dispute.
His shield was all of gold so red,
And on that was a boar's head,
Beside a carbuncle (red gem); 
And there he swore on ale and bread
How the giant shall be dead,
Whatever may happen!
His leg guards were of hardened leather,
His sword's sheath of ivory,
His helm of bright brass; 
His saddle was of ivory,
His bridle shone like the sun,
Or like the moon light.
His spear was of fine cypress,
That foretells war, and nothing of peace,
The head ground very sharp; 
His steed was all dapple gray,
It goes at a slow walk on the way
Very softly and easily
In land.
Lo, my lords, here is a fit!
If you want to hear any more of it,
To tell it will I try
Now hold your mouth, for kindness, please,
Both knight and noble lady,
And hearken to my tale; 
Of battle and of chivalry,
And of ladies' passionate love
Right now I will you tell.
Men speak of excellent romances,
Of Horn child and of Ypotys,
Of Bevis of Hampton and sir Guy of Watwick,
Of sir Lybeux Desconus and Pleyndamour --
But sir Thopas, he bears the flower
Of royal chivalry!
His good steed he mounted
And forth upon his way he glided
Like a spark out of the burning log; 
Upon his top of his helmet he bore a tower,
And in that stuck a lily flower --
God protect his body from shame!
And because he was a knight errent,
He would not sleep in any house,
But lie in his hood; 
His bright helm was his pillow,
And by him his war-horse grazes
On herbs fine and good.
He himself drank water of the well,
As did the knight sir Perceval
So worthy in his armor,
Until on a day --
"No more of this, for God's dignity,"
Said our Host, "for thou makest me
So weary of thy true ignorance
That, as surely as God may bless my soul,
My ears ache from thy crappy speech.
Now such a rime I commit to the devil!
This may well be doggerel verse," said he.
"Why so?" said I, "why wilt thou prevent me
From telling more of my tale than another man,
Since it is the best rime I know?"
"By God," said he, "for plainly, at one word,
Thy crappy riming is not worth a turd!
Thou dost nothing else but waste time.
Sir, at one word, thou shalt no longer rime.
Let's see whether thou can tell anything in alliterative verse,
Or tell something in prose, at the least,
In which there may be some mirth or some doctrine."
"Gladly," said I, "by God's sweet pain!
I will you tell a little thing in prose
That ought to please you, as I suppose,
Or else, certainly, you are too hard to please.
It is a virtuous moral tale,
Although it is told sometimes in various ways
By various folk, as I shall tell you.
"As thus: you know that every Evangelist
Who tells us of the pain of Jesus Christ
Does not say everything as his fellow does; 
But nonetheless their essential meaning is all true,
And all agree in their meaning,
Although there may be a difference in their telling.
For some of them say more, and some say less,
When they His piteous passion express --
I mean of Mark, Matthew, Luke, and John --
But doubtless their essential meaning is all the same.
Therefore, gentlemen, I beseech you,
If you think I vary as in my speech,
As thus, though I tell something more
Of proverbs than you have heard before
Comprehended in this little treatise here,
With which to strengthen the effect of my matter; 
And though I do not say the same words
As you have heard, yet to you all I pray
Blame not me; for, in my essential meaning,
You shall nowhere find difference
From the meaning of that little treatise 
In imitation of which this merry tale I write.
And therefore hearken what I shall say,
And let me tell all my tale, I pray."
