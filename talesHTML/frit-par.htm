&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To tell his wickedness I will not desist;<BR>

1329 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <B>For we are out of his correccioun.</B><BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For we are exempt from his authority.<BR>

1330 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <B>They han of us no jurisdiccioun,</B><BR>
