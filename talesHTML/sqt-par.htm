592 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <B> For his honour, as ofte it happeth so,<BR></B>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For his honor, as often it happens so,<BR>

593 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <B> That I made vertu of necessitee,<BR></B>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So that I made virtue of necessity,<BR>

594 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <B> And took it wel, syn that it moste be.<BR></B>
