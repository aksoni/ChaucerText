		Because the lineation of the editions (which follow the
		manuscript in the division into lines), the interlinear translation is at times quite awkward and for some readers perhaps even distracting. Such readers may therefore prefer a translation without the original; for that translation <A href="mel-tran.htm"> click here</A>.

967A  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>a doghter which that called was Sophie.</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a daughter who was called Sophie.<br>
<P>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Upon one day it happened that he for his pleasure went into the fields to amuse himself.<br>
969 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>His wyf and eek his doghter hath he left inwith his hous, of which the dores weren faste yshette.</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His wife and also his daughter has he left within his house of which the doors were tightly shut.<br>
970 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>Thre of his olde foes han it espyed, and setten laddres to the walles of his hous,</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Three of his old foes have seen this, and set ladders to the walls of his house,<br>
970A &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>and by wyndowes been entred,</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and by windows have entered,<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and beat his wife, and wounded his daughter with five mortal wounds in five different places --<br>
972 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>this is to seyn, in hir feet, in hire handes, in hir erys, in hir nose,</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; this is to say, in her feet, in her hands, in her ears, in her nose,<br>
972A &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>and in hire mouth -- and leften hire for deed, and wenten awey.</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and in her mouth -- and left her for dead, and went away.<br>
<P>
973 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>Whan Melibeus retourned was into his hous, and saugh al this meschief, he,</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When Melibeus had returned into his house, and saw all this mischief, he,<br>
973A &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>lyk a mad man rentynge his clothes, gan to wepe and crie.</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; like a mad man tearing his clothes, began to weep and cry.<br>
<P>
974 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>Prudence, his wyf, as ferforth as she dorste, bisoghte hym of his wepyng for to stynte,</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Prudence, his wife, insofar as she dared, besought him to stop his weeping. <br>
975 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>but nat forthy he gan to crie and wepen evere lenger the moore.</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; but nevertheless he began to cry and the longer he wept the more he wept.<br>
<P>
976 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>This noble wyf Prudence remembred hire upon the sentence of Ovide, in his book</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This noble wife Prudence remembered the saying of Ovid, in his book<br>
976A &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>that cleped is the Remedie of Love, where as he seith,</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; that is called the Remedy of Love, where he says<br>
977 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>"He is a fool that destourbeth the mooder to wepen in the deeth of hire child</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "He is a fool that stops the mother from weeping on the death of her child<br>
977A &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>til she have wept hir fille as for a certein tyme,</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; until she has wept her fill as for a certain time,<br>
978 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>and thanne shal man doon his diligence with amyable wordes hire to reconforte,</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and then shall one do his best efforts with amiable words to comfort her,<br>
978A &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>and preyen hire of hir wepyng for to stynte."</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;and pray her of her weeping to stint."</b><br>
979 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>For which resoun this noble wyf Prudence suffred hir housbonde</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For which reason this noble wife Prudence allowed her husband<br>
979A &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>for to wepe and crie as for a certein space,</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to weep and cry as for a certain amount of time,<br>
980 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>and whan she saugh hir tyme, she seyde hym in this wise:</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and when she saw her opportunity, she said to him in this manner:<br>
980A &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>"Allas, my lord," quod she, "why make ye youreself for to be lyk a fool?</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Alas, my lord," said she, "why do you make yourself to be like a fool?<br>
981 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>For sothe it aperteneth nat to a wys man to maken swich a sorwe.</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For truly it does not befit a wise man to make such a sorrow.<br>
982 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>Youre doghter, with the grace of God, shal warisshe and escape.</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Your daughter, with the grace of God, shall recover and escape.<br>
983 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>And, al were it so that she right now were deed,</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And, even if it were so that she right now were dead,<br>
983A &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>ye ne oughte nat, as for hir deeth, youreself to destroye.</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; you ought not, for her death, to destroy yourself.<br>
984 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>Senek seith: `The wise man shal nat take to greet disconfort for the deeth of his children,</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Seneca says: `The wise man shall not take too great discomfort for the death of his children,<br>
985 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>but, certes, he sholde suffren it in pacience</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; but, certainly, he should suffer it in patience<br>
985A &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>as wel as he abideth the deeth of his owene propre persone.'"</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; as well as he abides the death of his own self.'"<br>
<P>
986 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>This Melibeus answerde anon and seyde, "What man," quod he, "sholde of his wepyng stente</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This Melibeus answered immediately and said, "What man," said he, "should stint of his weeping <br>
986A &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>that hath so greet a cause for to wepe?</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; who has such a good reason to weep?<br>
987 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>Jhesu Crist, oure Lord, hymself wepte for the deeth of Lazarus hys freend."</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Jesus Christ, our Lord, himself wept for the death of Lazarus his friend."<br>
<P>
988 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>Prudence answerde: "Certes, wel I woot attempree wepyng is no thyng deffended to hym that sorweful is,</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Prudence answered: "Certainly, I know well that moderate weeping is in no way forbidden to him who is sorrowful,<br>
988A &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>amonges folk in sorwe, but it is rather graunted hym to wepe.</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; amongst folk in sorrow, but it is rather granted to him to weep.<br>
989 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>The Apostle Paul unto the Romayns writeth, `Man shal rejoyse</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Apostle Paul unto the Romans writes, `One shall rejoice<br>
989A &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>with hem that maken joye and wepen with swich folk as wepen.'</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; with those who make joy and weep with such folk as weep.'<br>
990 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>But though attempree wepyng be ygraunted, outrageous wepyng certes is deffended.</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But though moderate weeping is granted, excessive weeping certainly is forbidden.<br>
991 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>Mesure of wepyng sholde be considered after the loore that techeth us Senek:</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Moderation in weeping should be considered in the light of the lore that Seneca teaches us:<br>
992 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>`Whan that thy frend is deed,' quod he, `lat nat thyne eyen to moyste been of teeris,</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; `When thy friend is dead,' said he, `let not thine eyes be too moist of tears,<br>
992A &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>ne to muche drye; although the teeris come to thyne eyen, lat hem nat falle;</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; nor too much dry; although the tears come to thine eyes, let them not fall;<br>
993 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>and whan thou hast forgoon thy freend, do diligence to gete another freend;</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and when thou hast lost thy friend, make an effort to get another friend; <br>
993A &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>and this is moore wysdom than for to wepe for thy freend</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and this is more wisdom than to weep for thy friend<br>
993B &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>which that thou hast lorn, for therinne is no boote.'</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; whom thou hast lost, for therein is no remedy.'<br>
994 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>And therfore, if ye governe yow by sapience, put awey sorwe out of youre herte.</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And therefore, if you govern yourself by wisdom, put away sorrow out of your heart.<br>
995 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>Remembre yow that Jhesus Syrak seith, `A man that is joyous and glad in herte,</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Remember you that Jesus son of Sirach says, `A man that is joyous and glad in heart,<br>
995A &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>it hym conserveth florissynge in his age; but soothly sorweful herte maketh his bones drye.'</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; it conserves him flourishing in his age; but truly sorrowful heart makes his bones dry.'<br>
996 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>He seith eek thus, that sorwe in herte sleeth ful many a man.</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He says also thus, that sorrow in heart slays very many a man.<br>
997 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>Salomon seith that right as motthes in the shepes flees anoyeth to the clothes,</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Solomon says that just as moths in the sheep's fleece do harm to the clothes,<br>
997A &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>and the smale wormes to the tree, right so anoyeth sorwe to the herte.</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and the small worms to the tree, just so sorrow does harm to the heart.<br>
998 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>Wherfore us oghte, as wel in the deeth of oure children</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Wherefore we should, as well in the death of our children<br>
998A &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>as in the los of oure othere goodes temporels, have pacience.</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; as in the loss of our other earthly goods, have patience.<br>
999 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>Remembre yow upon the pacient Job. Whan he hadde lost his children and his temporeel substance,</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Remember the patient Job. When he had lost his children and his earthly property,<br>
999A &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>and in his body endured and receyved ful many a grevous tribulacion, yet seyde he thus:</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and in his body endured and received very many a grievous tribulation, yet said he thus:<br>
1000 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>`Oure Lord hath yeve it me; oure Lord hath biraft it me; right as oure Lord hath wold,</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; `Our Lord has given it to me; our Lord hath taken it from me; just as our Lord wished,<br>
1000A &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>right so it is doon; blessed be the name of oure Lord!'"</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; just so it is done; blessed be the name of our Lord!'"<br>
<P>
1001 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>To thise forseide thynges answerde Melibeus unto his wyf Prudence: "Alle thy wordes," quod he,</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To these foresaid things answered Melibeus unto his wife Prudence: "All thy words," said he, <br>
1001A &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>"been sothe and therto profitable, but trewely myn herte is troubled with this sorwe</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "are true and furthermore beneficial, but truly my heart is troubled with this sorrow<br>
1001B &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>so grevously that I noot what to doone."</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; so grievously that I know not what to do."<br>
<P>
1002 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>"Lat calle," quod Prudence, "thy trewe freendes alle and thy lynage whiche that been wise. Telleth youre cas,</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Have summoned," said Prudence, "all thy true friends and of thy family those that are wise. Tell your case,<br>
1002A &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>and herkneth what they seye in conseillyng, and yow governe after hire sentence.</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and hearken what they say in advising, and govern yourself according to their advice." <br>
1003 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>Salomon seith, `Werk alle thy thynges by conseil, and thou shalt never repente.'"</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Solomon says, `Do all thy business by taking advice, and thou shalt never repent.'" <br>
<P>
1004 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>Thanne, by the conseil of his wyf Prudence, this Melibeus leet callen a greet congregacion of folk,</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Then, by the advice of his wife Prudence, this Melibeus had called up a great congregation of folk,<br>
1005 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>as surgiens, phisiciens, olde folk and yonge, and somme of his olde enemys reconsiled</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; such as surgeons, physicians, old folk and young, and some of his old enemies reconciled<br>
1005A &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>as by hir semblaunt to his love and into his grace;</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (as it seemed by their appearance) to his love and into his grace;<br>
1006 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>and therwithal ther coomen somme of his neighebores that diden hym reverence</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and therewithal there came some of his neighbors that did him reverence<br>
1006A &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>moore for drede than for love, as it happeth ofte.</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; more for dread than for love, as it often happens.<br>
1007 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>Ther coomen also ful many subtille flatereres and wise advocatz lerned in the lawe.</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There came also very many subtle flatterers and wise advocates learned in the law.<br>
<P>
1008 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>And whan this folk togidre assembled weren, this Melibeus in sorweful wise shewed hem his cas.</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And when this folk were assembled together, this Melibeus in sorrowful manner showed them his case.<br>
1009 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>And by the manere of his speche it semed that in herte he baar a crueel ire,</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And by the manner of his speech it seemed that in heart he bore a cruel anger,<br>
1009A &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>redy to doon vengeaunce upon his foes, and sodeynly desired that the werre sholde bigynne;</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ready to do vengeance upon his foes, and desired that the war should begin very soon;<br>
1010 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>but nathelees, yet axed he hire conseil upon this matiere.</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; but nevertheless, yet he asked their advice upon this matter.<br>
1011 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>A surgien, by licence and assent of swiche as weren wise, up roos</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A surgeon, by permission and assent of such as were wise, stood up<br>
1011A &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>and to Melibeus seyde as ye may heere:</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and to Melibeus said as you can hear:<br>
<P>
1012 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>"Sire," quod he, "as to us surgiens aperteneth that we do to every wight the beste that we kan,</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Sir," said he, "as to us surgeons it is our duty that we do to every person the best that we can,<br>
1012A &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>where as we been withholde, and to oure pacientz that we do no damage,</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; where we are employed, and to our patients that we do no damage,<br>
1013 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>wherfore it happeth many tyme and ofte that whan twey men han everich wounded oother,</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; because of which it happens many times and often that when two men have each one wounded the other,<br>
1013A &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>oon same surgien heeleth hem bothe;</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; one same surgeon heals them both;<br>
1014 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>wherfore unto oure art it is nat pertinent to norice werre ne parties to supporte.</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; therefore unto our art it is not fitting to nourish war nor to support warring factions. <br>

1169A &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>that is to seyn, that they be trewe, wise, and of oold experience.</b><br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; for sometimes it is necessary to be advised by many.<br>
1171 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>For Salomon seith, `Salvacion of thynges is where as ther been manye conseillours.'</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For Solomon says, `Salvation of things is where there are many advisors.'<br>

1173 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>First, ye shul eschue the conseillyng of fooles; for Salomon seith, `Taak no conseil of a fool,</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; First, you shall shun the advice of fools; for Solomon says, `Take no counsel of a fool,<br>
1173A &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>for he ne kan noght conseille but after his owene lust and his affeccioun.'</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; for he can not advise except in accordance with his own desire and his inclination.'<br>

1174A &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>and lightly troweth alle bountee in hymself.'</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and easily believes all goodness in himself.'<br>
1175 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>Thou shalt eek eschue the conseillyng of alle flatereres, swiche as enforcen hem rather to preise youre persone</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thou shalt also shun the advice of all flatterers, such as exert themselves rather to praise your person  <br>
1175A &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>by flaterye than for to telle yow the soothfastnesse of thynges.</b><br>

1176 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>Wherfore Tullius seith, `Amonges alle the pestilences that been in freendshipe the gretteste is flaterie.'</b><br>

1176A &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>And therfore is it moore nede that thou eschue and drede flatereres than any oother peple.</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And therefore is it more needful that thou shun and dread flatterers than any other people.<br>
1177 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>The book seith, `Thou shalt rather drede and flee fro the sweete wordes of flaterynge preiseres</b><br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; than from the sharp words of thy friend who tells thee thy truths.'<br>
1178 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>Salomon seith that `the wordes of a flaterere is a snare to cacche with innocentz.'</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Solomon says that `the words of a flatterer is a snare with which to catch innocents.'<br>
1179 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>He seith also that `he that speketh to his freend wordes of swetnesse and of plesaunce</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He says also that `he who speaks to his friend words of sweetness and of pleasance<br>
1179A &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>setteth a net biforn his feet to cacche hym.'</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; sets a net before his feet to catch him.'<br>
1180 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>And therfore seith Tullius, `Enclyne nat thyne eres to flatereres, ne taak no conseil of the wordes of flaterye.'</b><br>

1181 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>And Caton seith, `Avyse thee wel, and eschue the wordes of swetnesse and of plesaunce.'</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And Cato says, `Ponder thee well, and shun the words of sweetness and of pleasance.'<br>
1182 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>And eek thou shalt eschue the conseillyng of thyne olde enemys that been reconsiled.</b><br>

1183 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>The book seith that `no wight retourneth saufly into the grace of his olde enemy.'</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The book says that `no person returns safely into the good will of his old enemy.'<br>
1184 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>And Isope seith, `Ne trust nat to hem to whiche thou hast had som tyme werre or enemytee,</b><br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And Seneca tells the reason why: `It may not be,' says he, `that where great<br>

1186 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>And therfore seith Salomon, `In thyn olde foo trust nevere.'</b><br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; unless he has more love of the people than dread.'<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; that no man can vanquish nor discomfit, and that is<br>
1340 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>a lord to be biloved of his citezeins and of his peple.'</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; for a lord to be beloved by his citizens and by his people.'<br>
1341 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>Now, sire, as to the thridde point, where as youre olde</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Now, sir, as to the third point, whereas your old<br>
1341A &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>and wise conseillours seyden that yow ne oghte nat sodeynly ne hastily proceden in this nede,</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and wise advisors said that you ought not suddenly nor hastily proceed in this urgent matter,<br>
1342 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>but that yow oghte purveyen and apparaillen yow in this caas with greet diligence and greet deliberacioun;</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; but that you ought to prepare yourself and get ready in this case with great diligence and great deliberation;<br>
1343 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>trewely, I trowe that they seyden right wisely and right sooth.</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; truly, I believe that they spoke very wisely and real truth.<br>
1344 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>For Tullius seith, `In every nede, er thou bigynne it, apparaille thee with greet diligence.'</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For Cicero says, `In every urgent matter, ere thou begin it, prepare thyself with great diligence.'<br>
1345 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>Thanne seye I that in vengeance-takyng, in werre, in bataille, and in warnestooryng,</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Then say I that in vengeance-taking, in war, in battle, and in fortification,<br>
1346 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>er thow bigynne, I rede that thou apparaille thee therto, and do it with greet deliberacion.</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ere thou begin, I advise that thou prepare thyself for that, and do it with great deliberation.<br>
1347 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>For Tullius seith that `longe apparaillyng biforn the bataille maketh short victorie.'</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For Cicero says that `long preparation before the battle makes short victory.'<br>
1348 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>And Cassidorus seith, `The garnysoun is stronger whan it is longe tyme avysed.'</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And Cassiodorus says, `The protection is stronger when it is long time considered.'<br>
1349 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>But now lat us speken of the conseil that was accorded by youre neighebores,</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But now let us speak of the advice that was agreed upon by your neighbors,<br>

1352 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>the yonge folk also, that conseilleden yow to venge yow and make werre anon.</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the young folk also, who advised you to avenge yourself and make war immediately.<br>
1353 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>And certes, sire, as I have seyd biforn, ye han greetly erred</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And certainly, sir, as I have said before, you have greatly erred<br>
1353A &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>to han cleped swich manere folk to youre conseil,</b><br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; which advisors are enough reproved by the reasons spoken earlier.<br>
1355 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>But nathelees, lat us now descende to the special. Ye shuln first procede after the doctrine of Tullius.</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But nevertheless, let us now descend to the particular details. You should first proceed according to the doctrine of Cicero.<br>
1356 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>Certes, the trouthe of this matiere, or of this conseil, nedeth nat diligently enquere,</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Certainly, the truth of this matter, or of this advice, we need not diligently inquire,<br>
1357 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>for it is wel wist whiche they been that han doon to yow this trespas and vileynye,</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; for it is well known who they are that have done to you this trespass and villainy,<br>
1358 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>and how manye trespassours, and in what manere</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and how many trespassers, and in what manner<br>
1358A &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>they han to yow doon al this wrong and al this vileynye.</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; they have done to you all this wrong and all this villainy.<br>
1359 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>And after this, thanne shul ye examyne the seconde condicion which that the same Tullius addeth in this matiere.</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And after this, then you should examine the second condition which the same Cicero adds in this matter.<br>
1360 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>For Tullius put a thyng which that he clepeth `consentynge'; this is to seyn,</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For Cicero hypothesized a thing which he calls `consenting'; this is to say,<br>
1361 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>who been they, and whiche been they and how manye that consenten to thy conseil</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; who are they, and which are they and how many that consent to thy advice<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And let us consider also who are they, and how many are they,   <br>
1362A &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>and whiche been they that consenteden to youre adversaries.</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and which are they that consented to your adversaries.<br>
1363 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>And certes, as to the firste poynt, it is wel knowen whiche folk been</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And certainly, as to the first point, it is well known which folk are<br>
1363A &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>they that consenteden to youre hastif wilfulnesse,</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; they that consented to your hasty willfulness,<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; for truly, all those who advised you to make sudden war are not your friends.<br>
1365 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>Lat us now considere whiche been they that ye holde so greetly youre freendes as to youre persone.</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Let us now consider which are they that you consider so greatly your friends as to your person.<br>
1366 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>For al be it so that ye be myghty and riche, certes ye ne been but allone,</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For although it be so that you are mighty and rich, certainly you are but alone,<br>
1367 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>for certes ye ne han no child but a doghter,</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; for certainly you have no child but a daughter,<br>
1368 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>ne ye ne han bretheren, ne cosyns germayns, ne noon oother neigh kynrede,</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; nor do you have neither brethren, nor first cousins, nor any other close relatives,<br>
1369 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>wherfore that youre enemys for drede sholde stinte to plede with yow or to destroye youre persone.</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; for which your enemies for dread should stop pleading with you or destroying your person.<br>
1370 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>Ye knowen also that youre richesses mooten been dispended in diverse parties,</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You know also that your riches must be dispended in several parts,<br>
1371 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>and whan that every wight hath his part, they ne wollen taken but litel reward to venge thy deeth.</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and when each person has his part, they will take but little regard to avenging thy death.<br>
1372 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>But thyne enemys been thre, and they han manie children, bretheren, cosyns, and oother ny kynrede.</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But thine enemies are three, and they have many children, brethren, cousins, and other close kin.<br>
1373 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>And though so were that thou haddest slayn of hem two or three, yet dwellen ther ynowe</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And though it so were that thou haddest slain of them two or three, yet dwell there enough<br>
1373A &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>to wreken hir deeth and to sle thy persone.</b><br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And though it so be that your kin are more sure and steadfast than the kin of your adversary,<br>
1375 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>yet nathelees youre kynrede nys but a fer kynrede; they been but litel syb to yow,</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; yet nevertheless your kinship is but a far kinship; they are but little related to you,<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and the kin of your enemies are close relatives to them.<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And certainly, in that respect, their condition is better than yours.<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For, by justice and reason, there may no man take vengeance on no person<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; thou should consider if thy might and thy power can consent<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and suffice to thy willfulness and to thy advisors.<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For truly, strictly speaking, we can do no thing<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; but only such thing as we can do justly.<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And certainly in justice must you take no vengeance, as of your own authority.<br>
1386 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>Thanne mowe ye seen that youre power ne consenteth nat, ne accordeth nat, with youre wilfulnesse.</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Then must you see that your power is not consistent, nor accords not, with your willfulness.<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For a wise man reproves the avaricious man, and says thus in two verses:<br>
1612 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>`Wherto and why burieth a man his goodes by his grete avarice,</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; `For what reason and why buries a man his goods by his great avarice,<br>

1673 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>"I see wel, dame Prudence, that by youre faire wordes and by youre resouns</b><br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; `Well happy and blessed are they that love and bring about peace, for they are called children of God.'"<br>

1830A &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>to be doon on hem by the causes aforeseyd.</b><br>

1833 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>what vengeance he thoughte to taken of his adversaries.</b><br>

1836 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>"Certes," quod dame Prudence, "this were a crueel sentence and muchel agayn resoun.</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Certainly," said dame Prudence, "this would be a cruel sentence and much again reason.<br>
1837 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>For ye been riche ynough and han no nede of oother mennes good,</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For you are rich enough and have no need of other men's wealth,<br>
1838 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>and ye myghte lightly in this wise gete yow a coveitous name,</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and you might easily in this way get yourself a covetous name,<br>
1839 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>which is a vicious thyng, and oghte been eschued of every good man.</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; which is a vicious thing, and ought to be shunned by every good man.<br>
1840 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>For after the sawe of the word of the Apostle, `Coveitise is roote of alle harmes.'</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For according to the saying of the word of the Apostle, `Greed is root of all harms.'<br>
1841 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>And therfore it were bettre for yow to lese so muchel good of youre owene</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And therefore it were better for you to lose so much wealth of your own<br>
1841A &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>than for to taken of hir good in this manere,</b><br>

1842 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>for bettre it is to lesen good with worshipe than it is to wynne good with vileynye and shame.</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; for better it is to lose wealth with honor than it is to acquire wealth with villainy and shame.<br>
1843 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>And everi man oghte to doon his diligence and his bisynesse to geten hym a good name.</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And every man ought to do his best efforts and his main concern to get himself a good name.<br>
1844 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>And yet shal he nat oonly bisie hym in kepynge of his good name,</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And yet shall he not only busy himself in keeping of his good name,<br>
1845 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>but he shal also enforcen hym alwey to do somthyng by which he may renovelle his good name.</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; but he shall also strive always to do something by which he may renew his good name.<br>
1846 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>For it is writen that `the olde good loos or good name of a man is soone goon</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For it is written that `the old good reputation or good name of a man is soon gone<br>
1846A &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>and passed, whan it is nat newed ne renovelled.'</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and passed, when it is not renewed nor restored.'<br>
1847 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>And as touchynge that ye seyn ye wole exile youre adversaries,</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And as touching that you say you will exile your adversaries,<br>
1848 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>that thynketh me muchel agayn resoun and out of mesure,</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; that thinks me much against reason and out of measure,<br>
1849 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>considered the power that they han yeve yow upon hemself.</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; considered the power that they have given you upon themselves.<br>
1850 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>And it is writen that `he is worthy to lesen his privilege that mysuseth</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And it is written that `he is worthy to lose his privilege that misuses<br>
1850A &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>the myght and the power that is yeven hym.'</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the might and the power that is given him.'<br>
1851 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>And I sette cas ye myghte enjoyne hem that peyne by right and by lawe,</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And I assume (for the sake of argument) you might impose on them that punishment by justice and by law,<br>
1852 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>which I trowe ye mowe nat do;</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; which I believe you can not do;<br>
1853 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>I seye ye mighte nat putten it to execucioun peraventure,</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I say perhaps you could not put it to execution,<br>
1854 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>and thanne were it likly to retourne to the werre as it was biforn.</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and then it would be likely to return to the war as it was before.<br>
1855 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>And therfore, if ye wole that men do yow obeisance, ye moste deemen moore curteisly;</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And therefore, if you want men to do you obedience, you must judge more courteously;<br>
1856 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>this is to seyn, ye moste yeven moore esy sentences and juggementz.</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; this is to say, you must give more easy sentences and judgments.<br>
1857 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>For it is writen that `he that moost curteisly comandeth, to hym men moost obeyen.'</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For it is written that `he who most courteously commands, to him men most obey.'<br>
1858 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>And therfore I prey yow that in this necessitee and in this nede</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And therefore I pray you that in this necessity and in this urgent matter  <br>
1858A &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>ye caste yow to overcome youre herte.</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; you endeavor to overcome your heart.<br>
1859 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>For Senec seith that `he that overcometh his herte overcometh twies.'</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For Seneca says that `he that overcomes his heart overcomes twice.'<br>
1860 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>And Tullius seith, `Ther is no thyng so comendable in a greet lord</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And Cicero says, `There is no thing so commendable in a great lord<br>
1861 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>as whan he is debonaire and meeke, and appeseth him lightly.'</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; as when he is gentle and meek, and calms himself easily.<br>
1862 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>And I prey yow that ye wole forbere now to do vengeance,</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And I pray you that you will forbear now to do vengeance,<br>
1863 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>in swich a manere that youre goode name may be kept and conserved,</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; in such a manner that your good name may be kept and conserved,<br>
1864 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>and that men mowe have cause and mateere to preyse yow of pitee and of mercy,</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and that men may have cause and matter to praise you for pity and for mercy,<br>
1865 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>and that ye have no cause to repente yow of thyng that ye doon.</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and that you have no cause to repent yourself of thing that you do.<br>
1866 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>For Senec seith, `He overcometh in an yvel manere that repenteth hym of his victorie.'</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For Seneca says, `He overcomes in an evil manner who repents himself of his victory.'<br>
1867 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>Wherfore I pray yow, lat mercy been in youre herte,</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Wherefore I pray you, let mercy be in your heart,<br>
1868 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>to th' effect and entente that God Almighty have mercy on yow in his laste juggement.</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to the effect and intent that God Almighty have mercy on you in his last judgment.<br>
1869 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>For Seint Jame seith in his Epistle: `Juggement withouten mercy shal be doon</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For Saint James says in his Epistle: `Judgment without mercy shall be done<br>
1869A &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>to hym that hath no mercy of another wight.'"</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to him that has no mercy for another person.'"<br>
