49	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>For thanne th' apostle seith that I am free</b><BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For then the apostle says that I am free<BR>

50	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>To wedde, a Goddes half, where it liketh me.</b><BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To wed, by God's side (I swear), wherever it pleases me.<BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He says that to be wedded is no sin;<BR>

52	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>Bet is to be wedded than to brynne.</b><BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It is better to be wedded than to burn.<BR>

53	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>What rekketh me, thogh folk seye vileynye</b><BR>

54	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>Of shrewed Lameth and his bigamye?</b><BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of cursed Lamech and his bigamy?<BR>

55	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>I woot wel Abraham was an hooly man,</b><BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I know well Abraham was a holy man,<BR>

56	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>And Jacob eek, as ferforth as I kan;</b><BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And Jacob also, insofar as I know;<BR>

57	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>And ech of hem hadde wyves mo than two,</b><BR>

58	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>And many another holy man also.</b><BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And many another holy man also.<BR>

59	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>Wher can ye seye, in any manere age,</b><BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Where can you find, in any historical period,<BR>

60	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>That hye God defended mariage</b><BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That high God forbad marriage<BR>

61	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>By expres word? I pray yow, telleth me.</b><BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; By express word? I pray you, tell me.<BR>

62	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>Or where comanded he virginitee?</b><BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or where commanded he virginity?<BR>

63	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>I woot as wel as ye, it is no drede,</b><BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I know as well as you, it is no doubt,<BR>

64	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>Th' apostel, whan he speketh of maydenhede,</b><BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The apostle, when he speaks of maidenhood,<BR>

65	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>He seyde that precept therof hadde he noon.</b><BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He said that he had no precept concerning it.<BR>

66	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>Men may conseille a womman to been oon,</b><BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Men may advise a woman to be one,<BR>

67	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>But conseillyng is no comandement.</b><BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But advice is no commandment.<BR>

68	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>He putte it in oure owene juggement;</b><BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He left it to our own judgment;<BR>

69	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>For hadde God comanded maydenhede,</b><BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For had God commanded maidenhood,<BR>

70	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>Thanne hadde he dampned weddyng with the dede.</b><BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Then had he damned marriage along with the act (of procreation).<BR>

71	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>And certes, if ther were no seed ysowe,</b><BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And certainly, if there were no seed sown,<BR>

72	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>Virginitee, thanne wherof sholde it growe?</b><BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Then from what should virginity grow?<BR>

73	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>Poul dorste nat comanden, atte leeste,</b><BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In any case, Paul dared not command<BR>

74	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>A thyng of which his maister yaf noon heeste.</b><BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A thing of which his master gave no command.<BR>

75	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>The dart is set up for virginitee;</b><BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The prize is set up for virginity;<BR>

76	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>Cacche whoso may, who renneth best lat see.</b><BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Catch it whoever can, let's see who runs best.<BR>

<P>

77	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>But this word is nat taken of every wight,</b><BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But this word does not apply to every person,<BR>

78	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>But ther as God lust gyve it of his myght.</b><BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But where God desires to give it by his power.<BR>

79	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>I woot wel that th' apostel was a mayde;</b><BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I know well that the apostle was a virgin;<BR>

80	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>But nathelees, thogh that he wroot and sayde</b><BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But nonetheless, though he wrote and said<BR>

81	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>He wolde that every wight were swich as he,</b><BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He would that every person were such as he,<BR>

82	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>Al nys but conseil to virginitee.</b><BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; All is nothing but advice to (adopt) virginity. <BR>

83	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>And for to been a wyf he yaf me leve</b><BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And he gave me leave to be a wife <BR>

84	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>Of indulgence; so nys it no repreve</b><BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; By explicit permission; so it is not blameful<BR>

85	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>To wedde me, if that my make dye,</b><BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To wed me, if my mate should die,<BR>

86	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>Withouten excepcion of bigamye.</b><BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Without objection on the grounds of bigamy.<BR>

87	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>Al were it good no womman for to touche --</b><BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Although it would be good to touch no woman --<BR>

88	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>He mente as in his bed or in his couche,</b><BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He meant in his bed or in his couch,<BR>

89	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>For peril is bothe fyr and tow t' assemble;</b><BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For it is perilous to assemble both fire and flax;<BR>

90	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>Ye knowe what this ensample may resemble.</b><BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You know what this example may apply to.<BR>

91	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>This is al and som: he heeld virginitee</b><BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This is the sum of it: he held virginity<BR>

92	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>Moore parfit than weddyng in freletee.</b><BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; More perfect than wedding in weakness.<BR>

93	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>Freletee clepe I, but if that he and she</b><BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Weakness I call it, unless he and she<BR>

94	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>Wolde leden al hir lyf in chastitee.</b><BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Would lead all their life in chastity.<BR>

<P>

95	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>I graunte it wel; I have noon envie,</b><BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I grant it well; I have no envy,<BR>

96	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>Thogh maydenhede preferre bigamye.</b><BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Though maidenhood may have precedence over a second marriage.<BR>

97	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>It liketh hem to be clene, body and goost;</b><BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It pleases them to be clean, body and spirit;<BR>

98	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>Of myn estaat I nyl nat make no boost,</b><BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of my state I will make no boast,<BR>

99	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>For wel ye knowe, a lord in his houshold,</b><BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Whoever considers himself satisfied with his poverty,<BR>

1186	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>I holde hym riche, al hadde he nat a sherte.</b><BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I consider him rich, although he had not a shirt.<BR>

1187	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>He that coveiteth is a povre wight,</b><BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He who covets is a poor person,<BR>

1188	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>For he wolde han that is nat in his myght;</b><BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For he would have that which is not in his power;<BR>

1189	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>But he that noght hath, ne coveiteth have,</b><BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But he who has nothing, nor covets to have anything,<BR>

1190	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>Is riche, although ye holde hym but a knave.</b><BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Is rich, although you consider him but a knave.<BR>

1191	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>Verray poverte, it syngeth proprely;</b><BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; True poverty, it rightly sings; <BR>

1192	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>Juvenal seith of poverte myrily:</b><BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Juvenal says of poverty merrily:<BR>

1193	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>`The povre man, whan he goth by the weye,</b><BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; `The poor man, when he goes along the roadway,<BR>

1194	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>Bifore the theves he may synge and pleye.'</b><BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Before the thieves he may sing and play.'<BR>

1195	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>Poverte is hateful good and, as I gesse,</b><BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Poverty is a hateful good and, as I guess,<BR>

1196	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>A ful greet bryngere out of bisynesse;</b><BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A very great remover of cares;<BR>

1197	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>A greet amendere eek of sapience</b><BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A great amender also of wisdom<BR>

1198	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>To hym that taketh it in pacience.</b><BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To him that takes it in patience.<BR>

1199	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>Poverte is this, although it seme alenge:</b><BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Poverty is this, although it may seem miserable:<BR>

1200	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>Possessioun that no wight wol chalenge.</b><BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A possession that no one will challenge.<BR>

1201	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>Poverte ful ofte, whan a man is lowe,</b><BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Poverty very often, when a man is low,<BR>

1202	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>Maketh his God and eek hymself to knowe.</b><BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Makes him know his God and also himself.<BR>

1203	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>Poverte a spectacle is, as thynketh me,</b><BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Poverty is an eye glass, as it seems to me,<BR>

1204	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>Thurgh which he may his verray freendes see.</b><BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Through which one may see his true friends.<BR>

1205	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>And therfore, sire, syn that I noght yow greve,</b><BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And therefore, sir, since I do not injure you,<BR>

1206	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>Of my poverte namoore ye me repreve.</b><BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You (should) no longer reprove me for my poverty.<BR>

<P>

1207	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>"Now, sire, of elde ye repreve me;</b><BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Now, sir, of old age you reprove me;<BR>

1208	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>And certes, sire, thogh noon auctoritee</b><BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And certainly, sir, though no authority<BR>

1209	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>Were in no book, ye gentils of honour</b><BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And call him father, because of your nobility;<BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And authors shall I find, as I guess.<BR>

<P>
