&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So unwieldy was this sorry enfeebled soul.<BR>
56	<B>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And to the Manciple thanne spak oure Hoost:<BR></B>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And to the Manciple then spoke our Host:<BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I believe he would tell his tale badly.<BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For, were it wine or old or new ale<BR>
61	<B>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That he hath dronke, he speketh in his nose,<BR></B>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That he has drunk, he speaks in his nose,<BR>
62	<B>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And fneseth faste, and eek he hath the pose.<BR></B>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And sneezes fast, and also he has a head cold.<BR>
63	<B>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "He hath also to do moore than ynough<BR></B>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "He has also more than enough to do <BR>
64	<B>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To kepen hym and his capul out of the slough;<BR></B>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To keep him and his horse out of the mud;<BR>
65	<B>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And if he falle from his capul eftsoone,<BR></B>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And if he fall from his horse again,<BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In lifting up his heavy drunken body.<BR>
68	<B>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Telle on thy tale; of hym make I no fors.<BR></B>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Tell on thy tale; of him I take no account.<BR>
69	<B>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "But yet, Manciple, in feith thou art to nyce,<BR></B>

71	<B>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Another day he wole, peraventure,<BR></B>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Another day he would, perhaps,<BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I mean, he would speak of small things,<BR>
74	<B>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As for to pynchen at thy rekenynges,<BR></B>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As for to find fault with thy accounts,<BR>
75	<B>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That were nat honest, if it cam to preef."<BR></B>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That may not be honest, if it comes to proof."  <BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That which I spoke, I said it in my joking.<BR>
82	<B>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And wite ye what? I have heer in a gourde<BR></B>

84	<B>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And right anon ye shul seen a good jape.<BR></B>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And right away you shall see a good joke.<BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of this vessel the Cook drank fast, alas!<BR>
89	<B>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What neded hym? He drank ynough biforn.<BR></B>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Why did he need that? He drank enough before.<BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And when he had blown in this horn,<BR>
